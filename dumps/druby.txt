; Where has our WALLY gone?
We have to leave for VERDANTURF TOWN
very soon...
Hiya! Are you maybe...
A rookie TRAINER?
Do you know what POKéMON TRAINERS
do when they reach a new town?
They first check what kind of GYM
is in the town.
See? This is PETALBURG CITY's GYM.
This is the GYM's sign. Look for it
whenever you're looking for a GYM.
My face is reflected in the water.
It's a shining grin full of hope...
Or it could be a look of somber silence
struggling with fear...
What do you see reflected in your face?
Let's say you have six POKéMON.
If you catch another one...
It is automatically sent to a STORAGE
BOX over a PC connection.

WALLY'S HOUSE
I'm the ENERGY GURU!
I'll go for it and sell you what you need!
Oh?
Your @
...
Went for it stupendously!
As its reward, please give it this
EFFORT RIBBON.
LANDON received the EFFORT RIBBON.
LANDON put the EFFORT RIBBON
on @
You have to go for it a little harder.
If you do, I'll give your POKéMON
something nice.
Oh! Your @
, that EFFORT
RIBBON looks good on it!
The light of the lighthouse reaches
dozens of miles away.
I wonder if it doesn't startle POKéMON
in the sea.
Ooh, look at this!
The seaweed you can get around these
parts is fresh and full of life.
Why, it looks like it can even rear up
and attack!
Where the water is clean, the fruits
of bountiful harvest gather.
And where people gather, a market
soon starts.
That is how a town is born and grows.
Shopping where you can breathe the
scent of the ocean...
SLATEPORT is such a wonderful place!
If you put DOLLS or CUSHIONS on the
floor, they'll get dirty.
I'm going to buy some BRICKS so my
DOLLS and CUSHIONS won't get dirty=when I leave them out.
Yeah! I've waited so long for this!
POKéMON CONTESTS!=I'm going to enter!
But before I do, I have to catch some
POKéMON!
Whew... I'm just bushed...
I hiked over from MAUVILLE CITY.
But, boy, this city's huge.
If I'd known this, I would've ridden
my BIKE here.
STERN, the fellow who built the
MUSEUM, also happens to be the leader=of an undersea exploration team.
So, everyone calls him CAPT. STERN.
What is that over there?
That long line...
When I was a child, I visited the
MUSEUM often.
I used to dream about the mysteries of
the sea after seeing the exhibits.
Hey, there! Quit pushing!
This is the line, can't you see?
TEAM @
 has a policy of
assembling and dispersing at the=operation site.
Our BOSS is brilliant.
What would he want to do with a
MUSEUM now?
What's the new scheme, I wonder?
Our BOSS is scary when he's mad, so
I'd better not screw things up...
If there's something we need in the
MUSEUM, we should take it all!
Hey, you there!
Don't butt in!
A long line, huh?
It reminds me of the times I lined up to
buy smash-hit games...
Why are we even lining up and paying?
We should just march in!
The sea is just so vast...
Could the sea have been made by the
tears shed by POKéMON?
Do you know what they do with old
ships that become too creaky to sail?
They sink them in the sea so they
become habitats for POKéMON.
Whenever I visit here, I get carried
away and buy too much.
If you want to change your POKéMON's
nickname, you'll have to get the NAME=RATER to help you.
Any POKéMON you get in a trade, you
can't change its nickname.
The original TRAINER's love for that
POKéMON is in the nickname.
A POKéMON CONTEST HALL opened in
SLATEPORT recently.
I plan on entering after I improve the
condition of my POKéMON.
Do you know about the machine
BERRY BLENDER?
People have to work together to get it
to spin faster.
The faster you can make it spin, the
better
S you can get, I've heard.
It's used for making a kind of candy
called a
If you give a good
 to a POKéMON,
its condition will improve by a lot.
I was hoping that it was a famous star
so I could get an autograph.
But who's that being interviewed?
Isn't that CAPT. STERN?
That lady interviewer is so cool and
pretty.
When I grow up, I'm going to be an
international journalist!
CAPT. STERN says they discovered
something at the bottom of the sea.
I wonder what it is?
What could it be?
What's going on here?
Did the good CAPTAIN come back with
a big fish from the ocean floor?
Hey! Are you watching?
Am I on TV?
A TV interview! Here!
The CAPTAIN's a celebrity!
TY: Okay, CAPT. STERN, a big smile
for the camera!
GABBY: I see, I see. You've had a most
invaluable experience...
CAPT. STERN: Yes, indeed. We intend to
move ahead with our exploration.
GABBY: That's wonderful, CAPT. STERN!
Thank you for taking the time from=your busy schedule to talk to us.
We hope we can interview you again
with news of more discoveries!
CAPT. STERN: Whew...
That was my first time to be filmed for
TV. That was nerve wracking.
Oh! LANDON
You're looking great!
We made a huge discovery on our last
seafloor exploration.
We found an underwater cavern on
ROUTE 128.
We think it's the habitat of a POKéMON
that's said to have been long extinct.
Fufufu...
CAPT. STERN, I presume.
We of TEAM @
 will assume
control of your submarine!
Your objections are meaningless!
We expect your total cooperation!
Fufufu...
Just watch and learn what TEAM=@
 has planned!
CAPT. STERN: What was that all about?
It sounded like someone using a
megaphone...
Where did it come from?
It's from the HARBOR!
The submarine!
They're trying to take it!
LANDON
Please, come with me!

UNCLE: It's because of POKéMON that
this boy's got more pep, I suppose...=But he's become a bit too peppy...
WALLY: Aww, UNCLE, please?
I want to challenge this GYM and see
how much better I've become.
Please? May I, please?
UNCLE: Now hold on, WALLY.
Since you started living with POKéMON,
you have grown quite a lot stronger.
But don't you think you're pushing it
to suddenly challenge a GYM?
WALLY: I'm not pushing it.
If I combine forces with RALTS,
we can beat anyone!
WALLY: Oh! Hi, LANDON!
I've gotten a lot stronger since we
met.
LANDON, I want you and my UNCLE to
understand that.
LANDON, please, will you have a
battle with me?
WALLY: Oh... If you won't battle me,
LANDON, my UNCLE won't know that I've=become really strong.
UNCLE: LANDON
, was it?
On WALLY's behalf, can I ask you to=battle with him just this once?
I don't think he's going to listen to
any reason the way he is now.
WALLY: LANDON, please!
Battle with me, please.
WALLY: LANDON, thank you.
Okay... Here I come!
WALLY: ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
I lost...
WALLY: UNCLE...
I'll go back to VERDANTURF...
LANDON, thank you.
Being a TRAINER is tough, isn't it?
It's not enough just to have POKéMON
and make them battle. That isn't what=being a real TRAINER is about.
UNCLE: WALLY, there's no need to be so
down on yourself.
Why, what's keeping you from becoming
stronger and stronger?
Come on, let's go home.
Everyone's waiting for you.
UNCLE: LANDON
, it just dawned on me
that you must be the TRAINER who kept=an eye out for WALLY when he caught=his POKéMON.
Why don't you visit us in VERDANTURF
sometime?=I'm sure WALLY would enjoy it.
WATTSON: Oh, LANDON
You look like you have a lot of zip!=That's a good thing, wahahahaha!
Fine! I've decided!
I need a favor, LANDON
MAUVILLE CITY has an underground
sector called NEW MAUVILLE.
LANDON
, I'd like you to go there and
switch off the GENERATOR.
The GENERATOR has been running a bit
haywire. It's getting unsafe.
Here, this is the KEY to get into NEW
MAUVILLE.
WATTSON: Don't you worry about it.
It won't be a challenge to you.
The entrance to NEW MAUVILLE is just
a short SURF away from ROUTE 110.
That's it, then, you have my trust!
Wahahahaha!
WATTSON: Wahahahaha!
I knew it, LANDON
! I knew I'd made
the right choice asking you!
This is my thanks - a TM containing
THUNDERBOLT!
Go on, you've earned it!
WATTSON: Wahahahaha!
It pleases me to no end to see the
young step up and take charge!
You know, it's cool to have POKéMON
battles and stuff...
But if your POKéMON gets hurt, you
have to nurse it back to health.
The roads of this town stretch north
and south, and east and west.
Because of that, we get all sorts of
people coming through.
Have you been to RYDEL'S CYCLES yet?
RYDEL, the owner, is a very generous

POKéMON could jump you.

Hi, do you check out TV at all?
They've added a bunch of cool new

TV is so cool. I've seen my friends on
TV just out of the blue.
And, sometimes, they even put you on TV
without telling you.
I wish I would be on TV sometime.
That's why I think you should check
out TVs whenever you can.
Hi, have you been checking out TVs?
The DEVON CORPORATION...
We all just shorten it to DEVON.
That company makes all sorts of
convenient products.
Hm? A sneaky-looking man?
Come to think of it, yes, a shady-
looking guy went around the corner.
Have you taken the POKéMON GYM
challenge?
When you get that shiny GYM BADGE
in hand, I guess TRAINERS begin to=realize what is required of them.
Hey, that's RUSTBORO's GYM BADGE!
Out of all the POKéMON GYM BADGES,
RUSTBORO's is the coolest, I'd say.
Oh? Who might you be?
You're a new face around these parts.
Have you just transferred into the
POKéMON TRAINER'S SCHOOL?
I challenged the GYM LEADER, but...
It's not going to be easy winning with
my FIRE-type POKéMON...
FIRE-type POKéMON don't match up
well against ROCK-type POKéMON...

so often.
The old sailor MR. BRINEY lives in a
cottage by the sea.
He said he was going shopping in
SLATEPORT for his pet, PEEKO.
That old seadog, he must really love
that PEEKO.
Wow, you have POKéMON with you, too.
When I get bigger, I'm going to go
places with POKéMON, too.
POKéMON TRAINER'S SCHOOL!
If I go to this school, will I be able
to catch rare POKéMON easily?
If a POKéMON gains experience in
battles, it can sometimes change in=the way it looks.
A POKéMON changes shape?
If one did that, I would be shocked!
A POKéMON you get in a trade from
someone grows fast.
But if you don't have certain GYM
BADGES, it may not obey you...
Get out! Out of the way!
Wait! Pleeeaaase!
Don't take my GOODS!
Oh, it's you!
You're that fantastic TRAINER who
helped me in PETALBURG WOODS!
Help me! I was robbed by TEAM @
I have to get the DEVON GOODS back!
If I don't...
I'm going to be in serious trouble.
That shady character, I think he took
off towards the tunnel over there.
Oh! How did it go?
The DEVON GOODS?
You did!
You got them back!
You really are a great TRAINER!
I know! As my thanks, I'll give you
another GREAT BALL!
Your BAG's full.
I can't give you this GREAT BALL.
Excuse me, please!
Please come with me!
MAY: Oh, hi, LANDON
How's your POKéDEX coming along?
Mine's looking pretty decent.
I caught POKéMON in PETALBURG WOODS
until I ran out of POKé BALLS.
MAY: Oh, by the way, I passed MR. BRINEY
in PETALBURG WOODS.
I guess he's on his way home to his
cottage by the sea.
LANDON
, you just moved here so you
might not know this, but MR. BRINEY=was once a revered seafarer.
BRENDAN: LANDON, how's your POKéDEX?
Have you filled in any pages yet?
Mine rules.
I went on a POKéMON-catching frenzy
in PETALBURG WOODS until I ran out=of POKé BALLS.
BRENDAN: By the way, I walked by MR.
BRINEY in PETALBURG WOODS.
I bet he was on his way home to his
cottage by the sea.
I bet you didn't know this, but he's
always got a POKéMON with him.

After all the bother I went through
training on ROUTE 120...
I've got my pride-and-joy POKéMON
with me. This time, I'll beat WINONA.
The ground absorbs rainwater, and
trees grow by drinking that water...
Our FORTREE CITY exists because
there's both water and soil.
The CITY consists of homes built on
trees.
Perhaps because of that lifestyle,
everyone is healthy and lively.
Why, even myself - I feel as if I've
grown thirty years younger.
Living on top of trees is okay.
But sometimes BUG POKéMON come in
through windows.=It can be really startling.
Some POKéMON evolve when they go
through a Game Link cable.
Something unseeable is in the way.

MAY: Oh, hey?
LANDON
, are you shopping, too?
I bought a whole bunch of DOLLS and
POSTERS.
Of course, I've also caught a lot of
POKéMON, and I'm raising them=properly, too.
Actually, I'm more worried if you're
raising POKéMON properly, LANDON
I'll battle with you, so you can show
me your POKéMON, LANDON
MAY: Oh, why? LANDON
, haven't you
been raising your POKéMON?
That's not a very good showing as a
TRAINER...
MAY: Come on, battle with me, so I can
check out your POKéMON!
MAY: The POKéMON I raised won't be
beaten by your POKéMON, LANDON
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
I remember the battle I had with you,
LANDON
, on ROUTE 103.
That battle helped you become this
strong, LANDON
, didn't it?
MAY: I'm thinking of going back to
LITTLEROOT soon.
I've caught a decent group of POKéMON,
and my POKéDEX is coming along, so=I'm going home to show my dad.
LANDON
, what are you going to do?
Collect all the GYM BADGES and take
the POKéMON LEAGUE challenge?
Well, while you're collecting BADGES,
LANDON
, I'm going to work on my=POKéDEX. I'll complete it before you!
See you!
LANDON
, what are you going to do?
Are you taking the POKéMON LEAGUE
challenge?
Or, are you going to complete your
POKéDEX?
I might've lost to you in battling,
but I'll finish my POKéDEX before you!
See you!
LANDON
, what are you going to do?
Are you taking the BATTLE TOWER
challenge?
Or, are you going to complete your
POKéDEX?
I might've lost to you in battling,
but I'll finish my POKéDEX before you!
See you!
BRENDAN: Oh, hey, it's LANDON.
I'm running an errand for my dad.
No, I'm not buying any DOLLS.
Anyways, it's been a while.
Want to have a battle to see who's been
raising POKéMON better?
BRENDAN: Oh, what's the matter?
Don't have the confidence?
BRENDAN: Want to battle to see who's
been raising POKéMON better?
BRENDAN: Aww, but you know I'm not
going to lose to no LANDON.
Humph...
You've done a lot of raising.
That stings a bit - I had a head start
on you as a TRAINER...
BRENDAN: I...
I plan on going home to LITTLEROOT.
You know I'm helping out my dad on his
POKéDEX. It's coming together pretty=decently, so I should go show him.
LANDON, what are you going to do?
Collect all the GYM BADGES and take
the POKéMON LEAGUE challenge?
Maybe I'll do that, too...
Well, anyway, hang in there!
LANDON, what are you going to do?
Since you're that strong, are you
taking the POKéMON LEAGUE challenge?
Heh, even me - if I trained my POKéMON
a bit more, I should be stronger than=you, LANDON.
Well, anyway, hang in there!
LANDON, what are you going to do?
Since you're that strong, are you
taking the BATTLE TOWER challenge?
Heh, even me - if I trained my POKéMON
a bit more, I should be stronger than=you, LANDON.=Maybe I will go to the BATTLE TOWER.
Well, anyway, hang in there!

TEAM @
's, it will be a happier=place for POKéMON, too.
There! WAILMER!
Leap out of the water now!
Hunh? What do you want?
You're messing up our training, so can
you, like, get lost?
The POKéMON that come to this CONTEST
HALL are all prizewinners.=They come from all over the country.
My heart swells with excitement!
Have you seen that strange cave in
the cove at the edge of town?
I'm going to teach my POKéMON some new
moves for entering a CONTEST.
So, I'm going to see the MOVE DELETER
and make it forget HM moves.
I came from KANTO.
The HOENN region is beautiful with
all its water and verdant nature.
Hunh? Wait a second...
Could there be rare POKéMON that live
only in this area?
TEAM @
's been training their
WAILMER in the cove.
We SAILORS can't get our boats out
to sea with them in the way!
Ahoy, did you know?
Someone punted TEAM @
 out of the
way for us!
That got the WAILMER out of the cove,
so we can get our boats out again.
I was taking a relaxing snooze at the
seaside inn to the sound of waves...
When someone stole my POKéMON!
Who's the abductor?
TEAM @
? Is it TEAM @
My missing POKéMON...
It came back without me noticing!
I'm an ART DEALER.
I am a buyer and seller of fine art,
especially paintings.
I've heard that the MUSEUM here has
magnificent works on exhibit...
Even as we grow old and wrinkled, the
sea remains forever young with the=vivid brilliance of life...
Fwohoho fwohohohoho...
It was sixty years ago that my husband
proposed to me here.=The sea remains as beautiful as ever.
Mufufufu mufufufufufu...
Hm, you know of the peculiar cavern
in this cove?
That had been a natural formation, but
then that TEAM @
 lot came along=and made their renovations.
They call themselves the "nature-loving
TEAM @
"2!
But what they do and what they say
don't match at all!
That cave in the cove...
It seems someone sealed the entrance,=so no one can enter it anymore.
That TEAM @
 lot, they must
have gone away for good.

Why would you want it?
You're weird.
You can keep it, but keep it a secret
from STEVEN.
Is it really that fun collecting

Yeah, you think so, too! What are you
supposed to do with some weird rock?
Around MOSSDEEP, you can see wild
WAILMER.
It's called, uh...
What was it now...
WAI, WAI, WAI...
WAILMER watching!
The island's SPACE CENTER has been
launching huge rockets.
I'd heard from my mates in LILYCOVE
that the herd of WAILMER has=disappeared.
What went down over there, I wonder?
Wouldn't it be nice?
If the whole world was covered in
plants and flowers like this island?
All life needs the sea to live, even
though it makes its home on the land.
Life, having run its course, becomes
soil and returns to the land.
And the sea is always connected to
the land.
Yes, like the very shoreline here.
A voyage on a ship is fine.
But crossing the sea with POKéMON
using SURF...
Now that's an exhilarating trip!
Wouldn't you agree, youngster?
This rock has a special meaning to
the people at the SPACE CENTER.
They put it here as their wish for
their rockets to fly safely.
When you make a wish, what do you use?
Do you wish upon a star?
I use a wish tag to make it happen.
That's what I do.
It's a white rock.

I wonder what the world is like on the

Hm!
You've come all the way to SOOTOPOLIS?=You're no ordinary tourist.
But I suppose that doesn't make you an
extraordinary tourist, either.
SOOTOPOLIS sprang up as a town in the
crater of a volcano.
If you look up at the sky, the lip of
the crater is also visible.=So, all you see is the sky in a circle.

I've also been entrusted with the
protection of the CAVE OF ORIGIN.
This downpour is caused by a power
emanating from the CAVE OF ORIGIN.
That... That is the BLUE ORB.
I see.
Follow me.
STEVEN: This rain...
People and POKéMON need water to live...
But why does this rain fill us with
so much dread?
The rain clouds over SOOTOPOLIS will
keep building and soon extend all=over HOENN...
If that were to happen...
WALLACE: The CAVE OF ORIGIN is ahead.
No one from SOOTOPOLIS is permitted
to enter the CAVE OF ORIGIN.
But you must go.
Together with your BLUE ORB.
You must go regardless of what awaits
you inside the CAVE...
STEVEN: LANDON
, I never expected you
to be holding the BLUE ORB.
You'll be okay. With your POKéMON,
you'll get things done no matter what.
I'm convinced of it!

Oh, yes, can you hear out what my
friend has to say?
My name is WALLACE.
I'm this town's GYM LEADER.
I've also been entrusted with the
protection of the CAVE OF ORIGIN.
This sunshine is caused by a power
emanating from the CAVE OF ORIGIN.
That... That is the RED ORB.
I see.
Follow me.
STEVEN: This sunlight...
People and POKéMON need sunlight
to live...
But why does this sunlight fill us
with so much dread?
The blazing sun over SOOTOPOLIS is
intensifying... Soon, all of HOENN=will be under its withering glare...
If that were to happen...
WALLACE: The CAVE OF ORIGIN is ahead.
No one from SOOTOPOLIS is permitted
to enter the CAVE OF ORIGIN.
But you must go.
Together with your RED ORB.
You must go regardless of what awaits
you inside the CAVE...
STEVEN: LANDON
, I never expected you
to be holding the RED ORB.
You'll be okay. With your POKéMON,
you'll get things done no matter what.
I'm convinced of it!
WALLACE: You must go together with
your RED ORB.
You must go regardless of what awaits
you inside the CAVE...
STEVEN: You'll be okay. With your
POKéMON, you'll get things done=whatever happens.
I'm convinced of it!
The legend told by the old man on
MT. PYRE... It wasn't a made-up story.
The natural balance of HOENN is going
through a wrenching shift...
STEVEN: LANDON
, we owe it all to you.
The sky above SOOTOPOLIS has returned
to normal. For that, WALLACE sends his=thanks, too.
And, that same WALLACE is waiting for
you inside.
He's strong.
But the way you are now, you should be=on equal footing with him.
Give it your best shot.
All life starts at the CAVE OF ORIGIN,
and it all ends on MT. PYRE...
Where do people and POKéMON come
from? Where are we bound?
Let me guess, you're going to challenge
WALLACE?
Oh, you are really?
You're awfully brave!
Let me guess, you've beaten WALLACE!
Oh, you did, really?
Maybe I'll become your fan!
Hm!
You've come all the way to SOOTOPOLIS?=You're no ordinary tourist.
But I suppose that doesn't make you an
extraordinary tourist, either.
A circle of a night sky framed by the
crater of a volcano...
And in that ring, stars flicker and
blink as if they were alive...=It's my favorite scenery.
Hunh? Where is my house?

It must be tiring riding with our things

Well, this is LITTLEROOT TOWN.
How do you like it?
This is our new home!
It has a quaint feel, but it seems to be
an easy place to live, don't you think?
And, you get your own room, LANDON!
Let's go inside.
MOM: Wait, LANDON!
MOM: LANDON! LANDON! Did you
introduce yourself to PROF. BIRCH?
Oh! What an adorable POKéMON!
You got it from PROF. BIRCH. How nice!
You're your father's child, all right.
You look good together with POKéMON!
Here, honey! If you're going out on an
adventure, wear these RUNNING SHOES.
They'll put a zip in your step!
LANDON switched shoes with the
RUNNING SHOES.
MOM: LANDON, those shoes came with
instructions.

The power of science is staggering!
PROF. BIRCH spends days in his LAB
studying, then he'll suddenly go out in=the wild to do more research...
When does PROF. BIRCH spend time
at home?
If you go in the tall grass at the sides
of this road, wild POKéMON will appear.
It's not safe to go out there if you
don't have any POKéMON with you.
I can hear someone shouting down the
road here.
What should I do? What should we do?
Somebody has to go help...
Boy, am I glad you went and rescued

Are you going to catch POKéMON?
Good luck!

in a little fishing advice!
First, you want to face the water,
then use the ROD.
Focus your mind...
If you get a bite, pull on the ROD.
Sometimes you can snag something
immediately, but with bigger catches,=you need to time the pulls on your ROD=to haul them in.
Oh, is that so?
That's too bad, then.
Yo!
How's your fishing?
Is that right! That's great!
Haul in some big ones!
Oh, hey, don't get down on yourself!
I'll give you a little fishing advice.

MAY: LANDON
! Long time no see!
Oh? While I was visiting the hot springs,
you got the LAVARIDGE GYM BADGE.
You must have caught good POKéMON...
No, I guess you raised some.
I guess it would be okay for you to
have this.
MAY: With those GO-GOGGLES, you'll
have no trouble getting through the=desert near ROUTE 111.
But, wow, LANDON
...
Challenging GYMS...
You're trying hard because you don't
want to lose to me, I bet!
LANDON
, I think I should challenge
your dad in PETALBURG GYM.
LANDON
, see you again!
BRENDAN: LANDON, hey, it's been a while.
How's it going?
Hmm...
That's a decent collection of BADGES.
All right, then.
You may as well have this.
BRENDAN: Keep those with you if you're
planning on going into that desert near=ROUTE 111.
There should be some POKéMON that
are exclusively desert-dwellers.=You might look around for those.
As for me...
I'm considering challenging NORMAN,=the GYM LEADER of PETALBURG.
Unlike you, LANDON, your dad looks like
he really is tough.
See you around!
I have here an EGG.
I'd hoped to hatch it by covering it in
hot sand by the hot springs.=But that doesn't seem to be enough...
I've heard it would be best if it were
kept together with POKéMON and=carried about.
You are a TRAINER, yes?
And your POKéMON radiate vitality.
So, what say you?
Will you take this EGG to hatch?
Good! I hope you'll walk plenty with
this here EGG!
LANDON received the EGG.
Oh? You've too many POKéMON.
There's no room for this EGG...
As you wish, then...
If you have a change of heart about
hatching this EGG, I will be here.
Every so often, an EGG will be found at
the POKéMON DAY CARE.
Or at least that's how the rumor goes.
We draw as much hot water as we need,
and yet the hot springs never run dry.
Isn't it magical?
These hot springs appear near active
volcanoes. Veins of water under the=ground are heated by magma to well up=as hot springs.
Being buried in this hot sand is...
Sigh...
So warm and heavenly...
Eh? Gyaah! Ouch!
A POKéMON nipped my backside!
Oh, you like hot springs, do you?
That's surprising for one as young
as you.
I bathe in the hot springs every day.
I want to become a beautiful and strong
GYM LEADER like FLANNERY.
If people put POKéMON in hot springs,
it might be seriously strange.
Why, it might be an electric bath, or
a bubble bath, or even a lava bath...
They're claiming that these hot springs
are good for calming nervous tension,=relieving aching muscles, solving=romantic problems, and attracting=money...

But there's one man.
He's trying to dig the tunnel by himself!
There was a man who dug a tunnel for

I don't really get it, but hey!

There's a guy in there who's trying to

Since we're here, let's have a quick
battle!
I'll give you a taste of what being a

Wow! That's great!
LANDON
, you're pretty good!
MAY: I think I know why my dad has an
eye out for you now.
I mean, you just got that POKéMON but
it already likes you.
You might be able to befriend any
kind of POKéMON easily.
Well, it's time to head back to the

BRENDAN: Okay, so it's this one and
that one that live on ROUTE 103...
Hey, it's LANDON!
...Oh, yeah, Dad gave you a POKéMON.
Since we're here, how about a little
battle?
I'll teach you what being a TRAINER's
about!
Huh, LANDON, you're not too shabby.
BRENDAN: I think I get it.
I think I know why my dad has his eye=out for you now.
Look, your POKéMON already likes you,
even though you just got it.
LANDON, I get the feeling that you
could befriend any POKéMON with ease.

That seaside cottage is where
MR. BRINEY lives.
He was once a mighty sailor who never
feared the sea, however stormy.
The sea, huh?
I wonder what it's like at the bottom
of the sea?
If you're going to throw a POKé BALL,
weaken the wild POKéMON first.
It will be easier to catch if it's been
poisoned, burned, or lulled to sleep.
You're a thief if you try to steal
someone else's POKéMON.
You should throw POKé BALLS only at
wild POKéMON.
Oh, no, I'm not a TRAINER.
But that's right, if TRAINERS lock eyes,
it's a challenge to battle.
If you don't want to battle, stay out
of their sight.
I like filling my mouth with seeds,
then spitting them out fast!
You can have this, so you try it out!
Use it on a POKéMON, and it will learn
a move for firing seeds rapidly.
A word of advice!
A TM, TECHNICAL MACHINE, is good only
for one-time use.
Once you use it, it's gone.
Think twice before using it!

Yo, TRAINERS!
Whether you're hot to trot,=or cool cat not,=chill at my papa's spot!
Little kids can dart around so quickly...
You don't dare take your eyes off them
for an instant. It's very taxing.
Mine's with my POKéMON, so they should
be okay, but...
Our sand castle's taking a long time
to make.
You can have this!
We're going to get all the sand from
the beach and make a big castle!
And then we're going to be a king and
queen.
We'll let you be a servant.
The water around these parts is clean.
But, I get my ZIGZAGOON to pick up
litter from the shoreline at times.

back to haunt us eventually.

MAY: Hi, LANDON
, long time no see!
While I was searching for other
POKéMON, my POKéMON grew stronger.
So...
How about a little battle?
Yikes!
You're better than I expected!
MAY: LANDON
, you've been busy
training, too, haven't you?
I think you deserve a reward!
This is from me!
MAY: That's an ITEMFINDER.
Try it out. If there is an item that's
not visible, it emits a sound.
Okay, LANDON
, let's meet again!
I know it's a little silly coming from
me, but I think you should train a lot=harder for the next time.
BRENDAN: Hey, LANDON.
So this is where you were.=How's it going?
Have you been raising your POKéMON?
I'll check for you.
Hmm...
You're pretty good.
BRENDAN: LANDON, you've trained
without me noticing...
Good enough!
Here, take this.
BRENDAN: That's an ITEMFINDER.
Use it to root around for items that
aren't visible.
If it senses something, it emits a
sound.
Anyway, I'm off to look for new
POKéMON.
Wouldn't it be great to ride a BIKE
at full speed on CYCLING ROAD?
How do you like the way my raven-
colored hair streams behind me?
I grew my hair out just for that.
Oh, hey, you got that BIKE from RYDEL!
Oh, it's glaringly obvious.
It says right on your bike...

You should ride it around all over
the place - it's good advertising!
The two roads, one above, one below...
A road each for people and POKéMON.
Perhaps that is right and fair.
I don't have a BIKE, so I'll take a
leisurely walk on the low road.
Learning techniques will make BIKE
riding even more fun.
There are some places that you can
reach only by using a BIKE technique.
Which should I choose?
Make a beeline for MAUVILLE on
CYCLING ROAD, or take the low road=and look for POKéMON?

Total time:

Bravo! Splendid showing!
Your love of cycling comes from deep
within your heart.=You've shaken me to my very soul!
Your technique is remarkable.
I suggest you slow down just enough
to avoid collisions.
I would consider you a work in
progress.
Still, I hope you don't forget the
sheer pleasure of cycling.
My word... Your cycling skills border
on terrifying.
Most certainly, you need much more
practice riding.
...I am aghast...
You're perhaps not cut out for this
unfortunate cycling business.
You ought to give serious thought to
returning that BIKE to RYDEL.
This is CYCLING ROAD.
If you were to ride from MAUVILLE to
SLATEPORT on a MACH BIKE, you would=be rated for the number of collisions=and your total time.
Regardless of the results, I count on
seeing more challenges from you.=Always aim higher!
On this CYCLING ROAD, those riding
MACH BIKES are rated for their number=of collisions and their total times.
ACRO BIKES do not qualify for rating.
They are easy to turn, so it's not fair.

What's going on?
I was digging the tunnel without any
tools when some goon ordered me out!
That tunnel's filled with POKéMON
that react badly to loud noises.=They could cause an uproar.
That's why we stopped using heavy
equipment for tunneling...
I'm worried that the goon will do
something stupid and startle the=POKéMON into an uproar.

LANDON
In this vast world, there are many

Do you raise different types?
Or do you raise only POKéMON of a=certain type?
What do you think as a TRAINER?
Sorry, it's not my place to ask, is it?
Well, anyway, I hope to see you
again.
Hmm!
A GOOD ROD is really good!
Wouldn't you agree?
Hmm!
We're of identical minds!

Wherever there's water, try your luck

Of course you are! Go!
Achah!
LANDON

I was worried that you might be

MAY: But I had absolutely nothing to
worry about! Keep it up!
And, here! I have a present for you.
MAY: Use FLY, and your POKéMON will

But, to use FLY, you have to get the

You should FLY home and visit

I bet your mom's worried about you,
LANDON
Well, let's meet again somewhere!
BRENDAN: LANDON! So this is where
you've been looking for POKéMON?
Let me see how good you got.
I'll test you!
Now!
It's a battle, so battle!
Hmm...
You've gotten pretty darn decent.

Here, I'll give you this.
Try it out.
BRENDAN: Use FLY, and your POKéMON

Hey, you! Please don't go near the

Well then, here.
I'll give you this.
BRENDAN: You know it's more fun to

If I find any cool POKéMON, you bet
I'll try to get them with POKé BALLS.
Hey, your BAG's full.
BRENDAN: Where should I look for
POKéMON next...
It's a serious-looking machine.
The PROF must use this for research.
It's a PC used for research.
Better not mess around with it.
It's crammed with books on POKéMON.
It's a book that's too hard to read.
When a POKéMON battle starts, the one
at the left of the list goes out first.
So, when you get more POKéMON in your
party, try switching around the order=of your POKéMON.
It could give you an advantage.
When POKéMON battle, they eventually
level up and become stronger.
If the POKéMON with you become
stronger, you'll be able to go farther=away from here.
That PC in the corner there is
for any POKéMON TRAINER to use.
Naturally, that means you're welcome
to use it, too.
POKéMON CENTERS are great!
You can use their services as much
as you like, and it's all for free.=You never have to worry!
The POKéMON CABLE CLUB on the second
floor was built recently.
But they say they're still making
adjustments.
The POKéMON CABLE CLUB on the second

I traded POKéMON right away.
The clerk says they're all sold out.
I can't buy any POKé BALLS.
I'm going to buy a bunch of POKé BALLS
and catch a bunch of POKéMON!
If a POKéMON gets hurt and loses its HP
and faints, it won't be able to battle.
To prevent your POKéMON from fainting,
restore its HP with a POTION.
There's a lot to be said for living on
a small island like this in harmony with=POKéMON and the family.

ZIGZAGOON: Guguuh!
There's a stone cavern at the edge
of town.
I've heard you can find rare stones
there.
Even if a POKéMON faints and can't
battle, it can still use a move learned=from a Hidden Machine, HM.
Hey, how's it going, CHAMPION-

DEWFORD's GYM LEADER BRAWLY commands

Going against him with NORMAL-type

FIGHTING POKéMON will lay a serious
smack down on NORMAL POKéMON,=so be careful!
What's worse, the GYM is as dark as

But it will get brighter after defeating

Whoah! It's turned too bright in here!
Your future is bright, too!

Come on!
Not enough power...
Your skill overcame my strength!
Your technique is commendable!
There's no need for BRAWLY to be

But... How?
How could I lose so easily?
I'm not going to waste this loss.
I'll use it to motivate me to train!
One day I'll become a GYM LEADER...
No, I'll become the POKéMON LEAGUE
CHAMPION!
Don't you dare brush me off!
It's not my fault if you cry!
Waaaaaaah!

I battle in the dark to make my heart

But because it's so dark, I can never
see BRAWLY's face...

Whoah, wow! You made a much bigger

You swamped me!
Okay, you've got me.

LANDON received the KNUCKLE BADGE
from BRAWLY.
The KNUCKLE BADGE makes all POKéMON

And, you'll be able to use the HM move
FLASH outside of battle.
If you'd like, use this TECHNICAL
MACHINE, too.
That TM08 contains BULK UP.
It's a move that raises both ATTACK
and DEFENSE stats.
I can see your talent becoming a giant
wave to cause a storm of astonishment=among TRAINERS one day!

Hahahah!
For me, SLUDGE BOMB is at the peak
of popularity. It's the one.
Hunh? You're telling me that you don't
know about SLUDGE BOMB?
That's outright pitiful.
I'll give you one.
I love SLUDGE BOMB.
But POKéMON with the
"2=move are in, too.
Gorge your eyes on this!
It's a SILK SCARF. It's right at the
cutting edge of fashion, yeah!
Oh, I can see your eyes twinkling!
You appreciate my dazzling style!
Oh, you're a delight!
Here you go. I want you to have it!
Oh, you don't have room?
Now, listen tight, this SCARF is a must-
have! Why, I would sell all my items=in order to get it!
The SILK SCARF raises the power of
NORMAL-type moves.
It's a marvelous SCARF that will go
with almost all POKéMON!
Wow, you bothered to cross the sea
to visit DEWFORD?
Did you maybe come here because you
heard about BRAWLY?
He's so cool...
Everyone idolizes him.
Welcome to the HERB SHOP, home of
effective and inexpensive medicine!
You've come to look at herbal medicine
in LAVARIDGE?
That's rather commendable.
I like you! Take this!
That CHARCOAL I gave you, it's used
for making herbal medicine.
It also does wonders when held by
a POKéMON.
It intensifies the power of FIRE-type
moves.
Herbal medicine works impressively well.
But your POKéMON will dislike you for it.=It must be horribly bitter!
Hey, how's it going, CHAMPION-
bound LANDON?
LAVARIDGE's GYM LEADER FLANNERY
uses FIRE-type POKéMON.
Her passion for POKéMON burns stronger
and hotter than a volcano.
Don't get too close to her - you'll burn!
Hose her down with water and then=go for it!
Yow! That was a scorching hot battle!
Owowowowow!
Yikes, it's hot!
I'm blinded by sweat in my eyes...
Being buried in hot sand promotes
circulation.
It's effective for healing pain in
your joints.
I'm trying to relieve my stress.
Don't come along and stress me out!
I hope FLANNERY flames you good!
Haaah... Whew...
If you spend too much time buried in
hot sand, it tuckers you out...
You must be getting tired by now.
You'd like to rest in the hot sand,=wouldn't you?
But you should know that maintaining
your willpower is an important ability=for all TRAINERS.
Play with fire, and be burned...
Your skill is real...
But our LEADER FLANNERY is strong.
If you don't watch yourself, you'll be
burned seriously.
Can your POKéMON withstand
392-degree heat?
It didn't burn hotly enough...
The temperature of magma is
392 degrees.
Your POKéMON beat me, so they should
easily survive in magma.
Um...
Okay, I'll battle with you.
Oh, but you're too strong.
I'm going to be a pretty and strong
TRAINER just like FLANNERY.
Welcome... No, wait.
Puny TRAINER, how good to see you've
made it here!
I have been entrusted with the...
No, wait.
I am FLANNERY, and I'm the GYM
LEADER here!
Uh...
Dare not underestimate me, though=I have been LEADER only a short time!
With skills inherited from my grand-
father, I shall, uh...demonstrate the=hot moves we have honed on this land!
Oh...
I guess I was trying too hard...
I... I've only recently become a GYM
LEADER.
I tried too hard to be someone I'm not.
I have to do things my natural way.
If I don't, my POKéMON will be confused.
Thanks for teaching me that.
For that, you deserve this.
LANDON received the HEAT BADGE
from FLANNERY.
If you have a HEAT BADGE, all POKéMON
up to Level 50, even those you get in=trades from other people, will obey=you completely.
And, it lets POKéMON use the HM move
STRENGTH outside of battle.
This is a token of my appreciation.
Don't be shy about taking it!
That TM50 contains OVERHEAT.
That move inflicts serious damage on
the opponent.
But it also sharply cuts the SP. ATK
of the POKéMON using it. It might not=be suitable for longer battles.
Your power reminds me of someone...
Oh! I know! You battle like NORMAN,
the GYM LEADER of PETALBURG.

FLANNERY'S CERTIFIED TRAINERS:
LANDON
My wife's warming an EGG in the hot
springs. This is what she told me.
She left two POKéMON with the DAY CARE.
And they discovered that EGG!
ZIGZAGOON: Pshoo!
Use X SPEED to add to a POKéMON's
SPEED in battle.
That will help it get in the first
strike - a decided advantage!
On MT. CHIMNEY's peak, there's a local
specialty that you can buy only there.
Give it to a POKéMON - it will be elated.
I think POKéMON get closer to their
TRAINERS if they spend time together.
The longer the better.
That's what I think.
I gave a RED
 to my POKéMON.
It looks a lot cooler all of a sudden.
Hmm...
Maybe I ought to eat a RED
Hohoho! Hey, kid, you can reach
the hot springs from here.
If POKéMON are getting rest, so too
should their TRAINERS.
I'm having a hard time deciding if I
should make my SKITTY evolve or not.
I only have to use this MOON STONE,
but it's so hard to decide...
If I make it evolve, it will become
much stronger.
But it will look so different, too.
SKITTY: Miyao?
This NUGGET I found here...
I suppose I'll have to sell it, seeing=as how it has no other use.
They had a sketch of my POKéMON up
on the wall over there, but they=changed it with a new one already.
I'm going to enter my HANA in CONTESTS
so we can get her sketch up again!
Hi, are you making any
You should come by with a bunch of
BERRIES sometime.
You see how they display a sketch of
a CONTEST winner here?
I sketch them!
If any of your POKéMON wins a CONTEST,
I'd gladly make a sketch of it!
Hello! Congratulations!
I've put up a sketch of your POKéMON
right here for everyone to see!
We do all right in the preliminary round,
but we can never win the appeals...
Maybe it means I have to watch what
other contestants are doing...
See!
My POKéMON won all these RIBBONS!
Have your POKéMON earned any RIBBONS?
You can check them on your POKéNAV.
I can't beat GYM LEADERS...
I can't win any CONTESTS...
I've been here, there, and everywhere,
and it's all for naught...
POKéMON CONTESTS
SUPER RANK STAGE!
Oh, hello.
You are?
Okay, your name's LANDON
I can see that you're a TRAINER.
So that means you use the POKéMON
Storage System I developed.
How I arrived at that conclusion is
a simple deductive process.
You spoke to me because you wanted
to access something on this PC.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm LANETTE.
Honestly, I'm glad to meet you - it's
great you're using the Storage System.
If you could, please visit me at home.
My house is on ROUTE 114.
I wonder what POKéMON looked like
long, long ago?
Maybe the FOSSIL MANIAC at the edge
of town will know.
In the fields of FALLARBOR, we plant
seedlings of hardy trees that thrive=even in volcanic ash.
PROF. COZMO: Oh...
I never should have let myself be=conned into telling TEAM @
 where=you can find METEORITES...
That METEORITE from METEOR FALLS...
It's never going to be mine now...
Oh!
Hah?
That item...
Could it be?
Is it the METEORITE that TEAM @
took from METEOR FALLS?
Please, may I have it?
I'm not asking for it for free.
How about in exchange for this TM?
PROF. COZMO: This TM, it represents
my feeling of gratitude.=Please use it!
PROF. COZMO: Oh, I can't believe it.
This is really, really great!
This is really going to help my research!
PROF. COZMO: Oh, but...
I'm crushed with disappointment...
PROF. COZMO: Please, may I have that
METEORITE?
I'm not asking for it for free.
How about in exchange for this TM?
PROF. COZMO went off to METEOR FALLS
on ROUTE 114 with some people from=TEAM @
Poor PROF. COZMO...
He's so depressed... I feel sorry for him.
Look at PROF. COZMO...
He's so happy! I think it's cute.
I'm the MOVE TUTOR.
I know all the moves that POKéMON
learn - every one of them - and I can=teach POKéMON those moves.
I can teach a move to a POKéMON
of yours if you'd like.
I'll do it for a HEART SCALE.
I'm collecting those now.
Oh! That's it! That's an honest to
goodness HEART SCALE!
Let me guess, you want me to teach
a move?
Which POKéMON needs tutoring?
Which move should I teach?
Sorry...
It doesn't appear as if I have any move
I can teach that POKéMON.
LANDON handed over one HEART SCALE
in exchange.
If your POKéMON need to learn a move,
come back with a HEART SCALE.
Hunh? There isn't a single move that
I can teach an EGG.
I went in through the entrance and
took a look around the CONTEST hall.
Getting up on that big stage...
It's going to be tense!
Oh, my love for POKéMON...
The attraction they evoke in me...
Whoops!
You weren't meant to see that!=Well, anyway.
If you're entering a CONTEST, try this
move on for size.
My feelings for POKéMON...
Oh, they attract me so...
Which CONTEST are you planning on
entering?
If you're entering a COOL CONTEST,
a cool POKéMON has to be the one!
Pick a POKéMON worthy of the CONTEST
theme, and make sure it has the=right set of moves to match.
That's fundamental!
Which CONTEST are you entering?
Want a piece of advice?
In any CONTEST, for example, a CUTE
CONTEST, I don't think they judge you=only on cuteness in the first round.
You need to work out ways for raising
POKéMON better.
I raised my POKéMON to be cute.
I found out you can put POKéMON in
a CONTEST for cuteness!
I'm so glad I raised my POKéMON with
loving care...
My POKéMON rules!
It's cool, tough yet beautiful, cute,
and smart. It's complete!
I may as well go for wins in every
single CONTEST.
POKéMON CONTESTS
NORMAL RANK STAGE!
For any POKéMON match, X SPECIAL
is crucial.
It jacks up the power of some moves
even though it's only for one battle.
They don't sell any items that will let
you win CONTESTS...
It means you have to raise POKéMON
diligently on an everyday basis.
The NEST BALL works better on
weakened POKéMON.
VERDANTURF is the only place you can
buy it.
I daresay a TRAINER isn't qualified if
POKéMON aren't settled and friendly.=Have you given them any
Let me hazard a guess why you're in
VERDANTURF. The reason: CONTESTS.
All CONTEST challenges originate here.
WALLY: I lost to you, LANDON, but I'm
not feeling down anymore.
Because I have a new purpose in life.
Together with my RALTS, I'm going=to challenge POKéMON GYMS and become=a great TRAINER.
Please watch me, LANDON.
I'm going to be stronger than you.
When I do, I'm going to challenge you
to another battle.
WALLY: Please watch me, LANDON.
I'm going to get stronger than you.
When I do, I'm going to challenge you
to another battle.
UNCLE: Oh! LANDON
WALLY's next door.
But, boy, there's something I have to
tell you.
This natural environment is doing
wonders for WALLY's health.
Maybe it's not just the environment.
It could be POKéMON that are giving the=boy hope.
WALLY's gone away...
He slipped off on his own...
UNCLE: Is that right?
WALLY's gone away that far all by=himself...
Well, I have to give him credit - he is
my little brother's son.
WANDA: You are?
Oh, right, I get it!
You're the LANDON who WALLY was
telling me about.
I'm WALLY's cousin.
Glad to meet you!
I think WALLY's become a lot more lively
and healthy since he came here.
WANDA: Don't worry about WALLY.
He'll be just fine.
I know my little cousin, and he has
POKéMON with him, too.
Thanks to you, I can see my girlfriend
every day.=Happy? You bet I am!
My daughter's boyfriend is a very
driven and passionate sort of person.
He's been digging a tunnel nonstop
just so he can see my daughter.
My daughter's a little concerned,
so she goes out to the tunnel a lot.
It's amazing. My daughter's boyfriend
was digging the tunnel by hand!
It's so incredible!
If anything were to happen to WALLY,
I would never be able to look his=parents in PETALBURG in the eye...
WALLY was in EVER GRANDE?
His parents in PETALBURG would be
astonished to hear that!
Let me see your POKéMON.
I'll check to see how much it likes you.
Oh.
Your POKéMON...
It adores you.
It can't possibly love you any more.=I even feel happy seeing it.
It seems to be very happy.
It obviously likes you a whole lot.
It likes you quite a lot.
It seems to want to be babied a little.
It's getting used to you.
It seems to believe in you.
It's not very used to you yet.
It neither loves nor hates you.
It's very wary.
It has scary viciousness in its eyes.=It doesn't like you much at all.
This is a little hard for me to say...
Your POKéMON simply detests you.
Doesn't that make you uncomfortable?
PIKACHU: Pika pika!
Far away, deep in EVER GRANDE CITY,
is the POKéMON LEAGUE.
The TRAINERS who gather there are
all frighteningly well skilled.
In the POKéMON LEAGUE, I think the
rules say that you have to battle the=ELITE FOUR all in a row.
If you lose to any of them, you have
to begin your challenge again from the=first one.
What color is your TRAINER'S CARD?
Mine's copper!
PACIFIDLOG TOWN floats on top of
a colony of CORSOLA.
If I told you that, would you believe me?
The ancestors of the people in
PACIFIDLOG were said to have been=born on boats and then lived and died =aboard them.
I understand that they lived that way
because they were searching for=something.
In the HOENN region, there are three
POKéMON that represent the power of=rock, ice, and steel.
Each of them is said to hide away deep
inside caves.
That's the story I heard when I was
just a little kid.
"Six dots open three doors."2
Grandpa used to say that, but I don't
know what he meant.
Er-hem!
I am the POKéMON FAN CLUB's most
important person, the CHAIRMAN's=younger brother.
I'm here enjoying my vacation with
POKéMON, yes, indeed.
Ah!
Your POKéMON...
It clearly likes you very much.
A POKéMON that adoring and adorable
deserves a TM like this, no?
Hmm...
It's not bad, but it's also not good.
You, as the TRAINER, need to put in
some more effort.
It has a vicious look to it.
A frightening POKéMON like that
deserves a TM like this.
If a POKéMON likes you a lot, RETURN's
power is enhanced.
If it doesn't like you, FRUSTRATION's
power goes up.
Oh, yes. In about @
 or so days,
I should be getting a good TM or two.
You should come see me then.
I'll give you a TM that's suitable for=your POKéMON.
AZURILL: Rurii.
It appears to be very friendly with the
TRAINER.
AZURILL: Rururi!
It doesn't appear to like the TRAINER
very much.
Hello, TRAINER. Would you do me a favor
and trade POKéMON with me?
Living in PACIFIDLOG, I can only catch
certain kinds of POKéMON.
? Do you have one?
I'll trade you my @
 for it.
Wow!
This @
 is so fluffy!
That's no @
I'm a little disappointed...
Since we traded, you and me,
we're friends, aren't we?
Is that a POKéDEX?
Did you get to meet a lot of different
POKéMON?
I wish I was like you.
People were saying they saw a POKéMON
FLYING high above HOENN.
Is it FLYING around all the time?
Doesn't it need to rest somewhere?
A sky POKéMON!
A sky POKéMON!
Where did you come from?
Yes?
YES TOWN?
I've never heard of a place like that.
No? That doesn't make any sense.
You have to come from somewhere.
Oh! Wait! You're not going to say you
were born at the bottom of the sea?
I can't see MIRAGE ISLAND today...
Oh! Oh my!
I can see MIRAGE ISLAND today!
MIRAGE ISLAND...
It must become visible and invisible
depending on the weather conditions=that make mirages appear.
Or is it really appearing and
disappearing?
You're...
Ah, you must be LANDON
, right?
Thank you for playing with WALLY a
little while ago.
He's been frail and sickly ever
since he was a baby.
We've sent him to stay with my relatives
in VERDANTURF TOWN for a while.
The air is a lot cleaner there
than it is here.
What's that? Where's WALLY?
He's already left, our WALLY.
I wonder where he could have
gotten by now?
I wonder how our WALLY is doing?
Hi there, LANDON
Our WALLY's become very healthy
since he went to VERDANTURF TOWN.
We owe it all to you!
When WALLY left town, you helped
him catch a POKéMON, right?
I think that made WALLY really
happy.
Actually, not just WALLY.
It made me, his father, happy too.
Happy that he's got such a great
friend as you.
This isn't a bribe or anything, but
I'd really like you to have this.
If your POKéMON can SURF, you'll be
able to go to all sorts of places.
WALLY's coming home soon.
I'm looking forward to that.
Oh? You met WALLY in EVER GRANDE
CITY?
Oh, LANDON
, don't be silly.
He may have gotten healthy, but he
can't go somewhere far away like=that all by himself.
WALLY was really happy when he told
us that he caught a POKéMON.
It's been ages since I've seen him
smile like that.
Oh, hello, LANDON! We've got
something we want you to have.
My husband has it, so please have a
word with him, dear.
I want you to keep this a secret
from my husband...
But our WALLY left VERDANTURF TOWN
without telling anyone.
You know, WALLY is frail, but
he's surprisingly strong-willed.
I'm sure that he'll come back safe
and sound one day!
DAD: Hm?
Well, if it isn't LANDON!
So you're all finished moving in?
I'm surprised that you managed to
get here by yourself.
Oh, I see.
You're with your POKéMON.
Hm... Then I guess you're going to
become a TRAINER like me, LANDON.
That's great news!
I'll be looking forward to it!
Um... I... I'd like to get a
POKéMON, please...
DAD: Hm? You're... Uh... Oh, right.
You're WALLY, right?
WALLY: I'm going to go stay with my
relatives in VERDANTURF TOWN.
I thought I would be lonely by myself,
so I wanted to take a POKéMON along.
But I've never caught a POKéMON before.
I don't know how...
DAD: Hm. I see.
DAD: LANDON, you heard that,
right?
Go with WALLY and make sure that he
safely catches a POKéMON.
WALLY, here, I'll loan you my POKéMON.
WALLY received a ZIGZAGOON!
WALLY: Oh, wow!
A POKéMON!
DAD: Hm. I'll give you a POKé BALL, too.
Go for it!
WALLY received a POKé BALL!
WALLY: Oh, wow!
Thank you!
LANDON... Would you really come
with me?
DAD: So, did it work out?
WALLY: Thank you, yes, it did.
Here's your POKéMON back.
LANDON, thank you for coming along
with me.
You two are why I was able to catch
my POKéMON.
I promise I'll take really good
care of it.
Oh! My mom's waiting for me, so I
have to go!
Bye, LANDON!
DAD: Now...
LANDON, if you want to become a
strong TRAINER, here's my advice.
Head for RUSTBORO CITY beyond this
town.
There, you should challenge the GYM
LEADER, ROXANNE.
After her, go on to other POKéMON
GYMS and defeat their LEADERS.
Collect BADGES from them,
understood?
Of course, I'm a GYM LEADER, too.
We'll battle one day, LANDON.
But that's only after you become
stronger, LANDON.
DAD: Hm? Aren't you going to the
POKéMON GYM in RUSTBORO CITY?
There's no challenge for me to
battle a greenhorn TRAINER.
LANDON, I want you to challenge me
when you become a lot stronger.
I'll battle you, LANDON, when you
can show me four GYM BADGES, okay?
DAD: I see... So, you've beaten the
GYM LEADER in RUSTBORO CITY.
But there are many more TRAINERS
who are stronger than you, LANDON.
Across the sea in DEWFORD TOWN is a
GYM LEADER named BRAWLY.
You should go challenge him.
DAD: Hm... LANDON, you have gotten
stronger.
I can tell by the number of BADGES
that you've earned.
DAD: Hm...
So, you did get four GYM BADGES.
Fine, as I promised, we will have a
POKéMON battle.
LANDON...
I'm so happy that I can have a
real battle with my own child.
But, a battle is a battle!
I will do everything in my power as
a GYM LEADER to win.
LANDON, you'd better give it your
best shot, too!
...
I... I can't...
I can't believe it. LANDON...
I lost to LANDON?
But, rules are rules!
Here, take this.
LANDON received the BALANCE BADGE
from DAD!
DAD: With that BADGE, the DEFENSE
of all your POKéMON will increase.
POKéMON that know the HM move SURF
will be able to travel over water.
This is my gift to you. LANDON, I'm
sure you can use it correctly.
DAD: TM42 contains FACADE.
It doubles the power of moves if
the POKéMON is poisoned, paralyzed,=or burned.
It might be able to turn a bad
situation into an advantage.
DAD: As the GYM LEADER, I can't
express how upset I am...
But as a father, it makes me both
happy and a little sad. It's odd...
DAD: Oh, yes...
WALLY's parents came calling
earlier.
They said that they had something
they wanted to give you, LANDON.
DAD: LANDON, you should go visit
your mother every so often.
I'm going to stay here and redouble
my training.
It would bother me as a TRAINER to
not avenge my loss to you, LANDON!
DAD: LANDON, how are things going?
The world of POKéMON is deep.
I honestly think that no amount of
training would ever be enough.
Hey, how's it going, CHAMPION-
bound LANDON?
The doors in this GYM open when you
beat the awaiting TRAINERS.
Whoops! The doors in this room are
already open, so don't attack me!
The TRAINERS of PETALBURG GYM use
all kinds of items.
The door at the left leads to the
SPEED ROOM.
The door at the right leads to the
ACCURACY ROOM.
The room's name will be on the
door, so choose carefully.
Once you've chosen the door...
Well, hey, go for it!
LANDON! Whoa! You've overcome even
your own father!
Like, whoa!
What a stunning turn of events!
The ability to attack before the
opponent...
Just that alone puts me at a great
advantage, don't you agree?
That was a magnificent battle!
Go on to the next room where a new
challenge awaits you.
At the left is the ZERO REDUCTION
ROOM.
The right door leads to the DEFENSE
ROOM.
Whomever you beat, and whomever you
may lose to, you never shirk from=training yourself and your POKéMON.
That's what I think being a
GYM LEADER is all about.
Don't waste your time trying to
lower my POKéMON's abilities!
My POKéMON's abilities weren't
harmed, but I still lost...
The next room is the STRENGTH ROOM.
Can you withstand brute force?
After you beat our LEADER, the
training has become a lot tougher.
Just when you think you're going to
win, your opponent restores HP...
Can you just imagine how awful that
must feel?
I'll show you exactly how awful it
feels!
I couldn't restore HP enough...
What ATTACK power...
I should have expected no less from
our LEADER's kid.
No, wait! A TRAINER's abilities are
earned only through effort.
I lost because my own efforts
weren't enough.
Go on! The ONE-HIT KO ROOM is next.
I'm going to keep training at GYMS.
One day, I'll become a LEADER.
I'm not going to take it easy just
because you're our LEADER's kid.
I'll show you how horrid it is for
a POKéMON to take a critical hit!
Your power...
You're the real deal.
Your father really is strong. He's
a TRAINER worth my respect.
And, I sense the same glow coming
from you as your father.
I hope that you'll stage a terrific
battle with your father!
Since your dad became the LEADER,
the TRAINERS of PETALBURG CITY have=become a lot tougher.
Giggle...
This is the ACCURACY ROOM.
It's pretty nasty when every attack
lands without fail.
You were a cut above me...
There are some even stronger
TRAINERS waiting for you.
The left is the DEFENSE ROOM, and
the right is the RECOVERY ROOM.
Your POKéMON's ATTACK power will be
on trial either way.
Do you know what we're trying to
achieve as TRAINERS?
We're striving to become soul mates
with our POKéMON.
The higher the DEFENSE, the more
reckless I can be in attack.
Our defenses weren't enough...
I think you've taught me a valuable
lesson here.
Now, go on! The left door goes to
the STRENGTH ROOM.
The right door opens to the
ONE-HIT KO ROOM.
Both of them have TRAINERS who are
offensively skilled.
Hi! Have you tried using SURF?
Our GYM LEADER told us to go all out
and beat you.
Even if you happen to be the
LEADER's kid!
But... I went all out!
The way you use your POKéMON...
It's like your father's style.
Go on through! The GYM LEADER, your
father, is waiting!
Sure, it's fine to make your POKéMON
stronger.
But what decides the winner?
Why, it's the feelings TRAINERS have for
their POKéMON.

PETALBURG CITY POKéMON GYM
PETALBURG CITY POKéMON GYM
NORMAN'S CERTIFIED TRAINERS:
LANDON
Traveling is wonderful!
When I was young, I roamed the seas
and the mountains!
Sigh...
I wish I could go on an adventure
with some POKéMON...
Crawl through some damp grass...
Climb rocky, rugged mountains...
Cross the raging seas...
Wander about in dark caves...
And, sometimes, even get a little
homesick...
It must be fabulous to travel!
NORMAN became our town's new GYM
LEADER.
I think he called his family over from
the JOHTO region.
I battled NORMAN once, but, whew,
he was way too strong.
How would I put it?
I just got the feeling that he
lives for POKéMON.
That PC-based POKéMON storage
system...
Whoever made it must be some kind
of a scientific wizard!
When my POKéMON ate an
ORAN BERRY, it regained HP!
There are many types of POKéMON.
All types have their strengths and
weaknesses against other types.
Depending on the types of POKéMON,
a battle could be easy or hard.
For example, your TREECKO is a
GRASS type.
It's strong against the WATER and
GROUND types.
But, it's weak against FIRE-type
POKéMON.
For example, your TORCHIC is a
FIRE type.
It's strong against the GRASS and
BUG types.
But, it's weak against WATER-type
POKéMON.
For example, your MUDKIP is a
WATER type.
It's strong against the FIRE type.
But, it's weak against GRASS-type
and ELECTRIC-type POKéMON.
Even if a POKéMON is weak now,
it will grow stronger.
The most important thing is love!
Love for your POKéMON!
Do you use REPEL?
It keeps POKéMON away, so it's=useful when you're in a hurry.
Do you have any ANTIDOTES with
you?
If you walk around with a poisoned
POKéMON, it will lose HP until it faints.=Take some ANTIDOTES with you.
Umm... If this goes here, and that
goes over there...
Then where does this thing go?
And what about that doohickey?
Aaargh! I can't make heads or tails
of this!
Hm?
Hi, I'm DOCK.
CAPT. STERN commissioned me to
design a ferry.
Oh! That there...
Are they DEVON GOODS?
But, hmm...
This won't do...
CAPT. STERN went off somewhere.
He said he had some work to do.
Could I get you to go find CAPT.
STERN and deliver that to him?
DOCK: Where could CAPT. STERN have
gone off to?
Could you go find CAPT. STERN and
deliver that parcel to him?
DOCK: Shipbuilding is an art.
A lot of things can't be figured out
just by calculating.
I really could use advice from a veteran
who knows the seas...
DOCK: Hi! MR. BRINEY's joined us to
lend us his help.
Thanks to the veteran sailor, the
ferry is steadily coming together.
DOCK: The ferry is finally ready!
The new S.S. TIDAL is truly a marvel
of technology!
But, I get the feeling that we can
make something even better.
You know, there's never an end to
technology's march.
MR. BRINEY: Ah, LANDON
It's been too long!
Aye, since I met you, this old seadog's
been feeling frisky!
So I've decided to help DOCK make a
ferry.
Aye, after all, a ferry would be able
to carry a lot of people.
But, you know, that DOCK is really
something special.
With his knack for technology and
my experience, I'm sure that we can=build one great ship, aye!
PEEKO: Pii piihyoro!
The seasons, the weather, where the
moon sits in the sky...
These and other conditions make the
sea change its expression.
That's right!
The sea is like a living thing!
I get seasick real easily.
So I get to help out here instead.
Designing a large ship is more like
making a big building than putting=together a transportation vehicle.
Don't you think it's strange that a
ship made of heavy iron floats?
It floats because of a principle
called buoyancy.
The sea between SLATEPORT and
PACIFIDLOG has a fast-running tide.
Ordinary ships can't make headway
through there.
You'd need substantial propulsion
to plow through those waters...
I want to raise a POKéMON that's
the ultimate in "great"2 for both=battles and CONTESTS.
It's vexing, trying to figure out
which moves I should make it learn.
Do any of your friends have any
BERRIES?
You can use that BERRY BLENDER and
make
S with your friends!
You should try it - it's a lot of fun!
I have two, so you can have one!
Make
S and put them in there.
When you make a
, everyone
has to put in a different BERRY.
If you win a CONTEST, they put up a
poster of your POKéMON on the wall.
It will have a portrait of your
POKéMON and both your names.
Want a tasty little bit of advice
for CONTESTS?
Using a certain move after another
certain kind of move sometimes gets=you extra attention.
If you know what you're doing, you
can score big in appeal.
Of course, your opponents might try
disrupting your POKéMON's showing.
My papa, he's a CONTEST JUDGE.
I wonder what I should be when I
grow up, a JUDGE or a GYM LEADER?
Hey, man, I'm like majorly cheesed,
you know. Like, you know, I just=wanted to know why my POKéMON=never won, you know, like, hey?
So, like, I gave the JUDGE my two
cents, you know, they're free.
And he wouldn't hear me out, like, hey!
So, like, total bummer, man!
Hey, like, you! Zip it, you know?
Just, you know, take this!
That's, like, TM41, you know?
Hey, it's TORMENT, you hearing me?
Like, it won't let the other guy
use the same move twice in a row, see?
Hey, now, you listen here, like,
I'm not laying a torment on you!
MC: Oh, my, my!
Now isn't that a dandy of a POKéMON?
Please! Do step right up and take
part in our splendid CONTESTS!
You'll do well! I'm sure of it!
My eyes have never failed me!
JUDGE: Well, hello there!
I see that you're a TRAINER!
Then, it just wouldn't do for you
to miss a POKéMON CONTEST!
Get a CONTEST PASS in VERDANTURF
CITY and enter anytime!
It's appeal time!
What should I lead with?
They didn't pay much attention to
my POKéMON's appeal...
Humph, that JUDGE, he doesn't know
a good thing when he sees it.
Oh, hi! You must be a serious fan to get
this close to the action.
I'll reward your enthusiasm with this
sage advice.
If a move goes over really well,
the audience will get excited.
The POKéMON that makes its appeal
right when everyone's excited...
Well, you'd think something good has
to happen!
I can't do this! I'm more freaked out
than my POKéMON.
I'm shivering and my heart is racing!
A battle and a CONTEST aren't the
same, but they are alike, too.
You need to work hard and believe
in the POKéMON you've raised.
That POKéMON looks like it's on top
of its game, huh?
A POKéMON that does good in the
secondary judging seems to be more=relaxed when it's doing appeals.
Will you look at that sorry sight?
Heh, my POKéMON's absolutely better
than that lot!
Don't you get the urge to move with
POKéMON if they're putting on an=energetic appeal?
POKéMON CONTESTS
HYPER RANK STAGE!
Hi, hi! I'm the NAME RATER!
I'm the fortune-teller of names!
I shall be pleased to rate your
POKéMON's nickname.
Which POKéMON's nickname should
I divine?
Hmmm... @
, is it? That is
quite a fine name you bestowed.
But! What say you, if I were to
suggest a slightly better name?
Ah, good. Then, what shall the new
nickname be?
Done! From now on, this POKéMON
shall be known as @
It is a better name than before!
How fortunate for you!
I see.
Do come visit again.
Done! From now on, this POKéMON
shall be known as @
It looks no different from before,
and yet, this is vastly superior!=How fortunate for you!
Hmmm... @
 it is!
This is a magnificent nickname!
It is impeccably beyond reproach!
You'll do well to cherish your
 now and beyond.
Now, now.
That is merely an EGG!
Er-hem! I am the CHAIRMAN of the
POKéMON FAN CLUB!
Being the CHAIRMAN, I am naturally
the most important!
No one could best me when it comes
to raising POKéMON. No one!
In any CONTEST, my victory is a
foregone conclusion!
But, that would deprive others of
their enjoyment.
So, I now while away my time
examining the POKéMON of others.
It is marvelous to witness how
others have raised POKéMON.
The contented faces of properly
raised POKéMON...
The kind and loving gazes of their
TRAINERS...
My heart is overwhelmed - there is
so much happiness.
Oh, my! Excuse me! I seem to have
nattered on far too long!
Please, do allow me to examine your
POKéMON and see how it's grown.
How is your POKéMON growing?
Allow me to examine it.
Hm, hm...
I see...
Hmmm... It's not bad, but it's not
good, either...
You, the TRAINER, must put more
effort into raising this POKéMON!
For instance, may I suggest that
you give it more
Oh, my...
Your POKéMON is growing quite well,
so you deserve a reward.
Unfortunately, you have no space for
this in your BAG.
Your @
, it is growing in
a most impressive manner!=It is one fine specimen!
But! If you were to give it this,
it would grow even better! Indeed!
Let a POKéMON hold that RED SCARF.
Everyone will recognize the coolness
of that POKéMON!
Let a POKéMON hold that BLUE SCARF.
Its beauty will be accentuated much
more than now!
Let a POKéMON hold that PINK SCARF.
It will draw out the cuteness of
the POKéMON some more!
Let a POKéMON hold that GREEN SCARF.
That will enhance the
smartness of POKéMON!
Let a POKéMON hold that YELLOW SCARF.
It will bolster your POKéMON's
toughness so much more!
I'm sorry, but I've nothing else to
give you! None at all!
After all, you're blessed with the gift
of raising POKéMON without resorting=to any items!
I love seeing POKéMON that love
their TRAINERS.
POKéMON are very sensitive to the
feelings of their TRAINERS.
If you treat your POKéMON with love
and care, they'll love you back.
When your POKéMON grow to love you,
please come show me.
Your POKéMON really adores you.
For you, a most compassionate
TRAINER, a gift from the FAN CLUB!
POKéMON are very sensitive to the
feelings of their TRAINERS.
If you treat your POKéMON with love
and care, they'll love you back.
If you keep letting a POKéMON faint
in battle, it'll come to resent it.
Soon, it will become less trusting
of the TRAINER.
In other words, it certainly won't
like you very much.
Do POKéMON enjoy having items used
on them?
Mine acted really happy when I gave
it some PROTEIN.
SKITTY: Fffnyaaaah...
ZIGZAGOON: Kyuuu...
AZUMARILL: Marimari?
Welcome to the OCEANIC MUSEUM.
The entrance fee is $50.
Would you like to enter?
Please enjoy yourself.
Oh? I'm sorry, but you don't seem to
have enough money.
Oh? You're with that group that
went in earlier?
You're the only one who's late.
You'd better go catch up to them!
Please visit another time!
We, TEAM @
, exist for the good
of all!
We were told to assemble here, so
we did, but...
Our BOSS, the lynchpin, isn't here.
If I ripped off the stuff here,
would it make me rich?
What I learn here, I can put to use on
nefarious deeds...
If our goons didn't bungle things
in RUSTBORO, we wouldn't be here!
I didn't have $50, so it took a long
time getting by the receptionist.
I want to learn about the sea and
use that knowledge for battling.
I get all giddy and gooey when I
see the sea!
For me, CAPT. STERN is the number
one role model!
The sea is vast without end, and
infinitely deep...
There must be many POKéMON that we
don't know about.
I want a sea POKéMON.
I think it would feel cool and nice
to hug.
Aiyeeeh!
What are you doing here?
Me? I'm the TEAM @
 member you
thumped before, remember?
Here, take this!
You have to forgive me!
Aww, darn it!
You so screwed up our plans!
I was going to rip off something
to make up for it, but...
Just you wait!
You'll get yours one day!
Awww, come on!
You have to take this and let me go!

"OCEANIC MINI FACT 1
Why is seawater blue?
"Light is composed of many colors.
"When light passes through water,

"OCEANIC MINI FACT 2
Why is the sea salty?
"Seawater contains dissolved salt in
the form of sodium and chlorine ions.
"These ions leach out of rocks and are
carried out to sea by rain.
"The concentration of dissolved salt
makes the sea salty."2
"OCEANIC MINI FACT 3

Thank you! That's great!
We can prepare for our expedition now.
Hehehe, hold it!
We'll take those parts!
CAPT. STERN: Wh-what?
Who are you people?
We're TEAM @
Our BOSS wants those parts!
Shut your yap and fork them over!
Awaaaah!
A kid beat me!
Oh, man, what a disaster...
The BOSS is going to be furious...
Humph, sniveling wimp!
Let me take care of this!
What?!
I lost, too!
Now what? If we don't get the parts,
we're in for it!
Arrgh, I didn't count on being meddled
with by some meddling kid!
I came to see what was taking so
long to snatch some parts, and you=simps are held up by a mere child?
I am TEAM AQUA's ARCHIE.
Tell me, why do you meddle in the
noble affairs of TEAM AQUA?
POKéMON, people, all life depends on
the sea.
So, TEAM AQUA is dedicated to the
expansion of the sea.
Don't you agree? What we are doing
is a magnificent undertaking.
Ah, fine...
You're still too young.
It can't be helped that you do not
understand our ideals.
But, if you ever oppose us again,
there will be consequences!
Heed my warning!
Farewell!
I am TEAM MAGMA's MAXIE.
Why on earth do you feel compelled
to mess up TEAM MAGMA's plans?
POKéMON, people, all life exists on land...
That's why TEAM MAGMA is trying to
expand the world's landmass.
Don't you agree? What we are doing
is a magnificent undertaking.
Well, no matter...
You're young.
Your inability to understand our
noble cause can't be helped...
But, if you were to impede us ever
again, you'll see no mercy from us!
Keep that firmly in mind!
Farewell!
CAPT. STERN: You're...
Ah, okay, you're LANDON
...
Anyway, that was a tense situation!
Thank you for saving us!
Oh, yes, I almost forgot that you
even brought the parts from DEVON!
LANDON handed over the DEVON GOODS
to CAPT. STERN.
CAPT. STERN: Whoops!
There's no time to lose!
We have to set out on our ocean floor
expedition really soon.
Thanks, and excuse me!
I saw a model of a ship here.
It reminded me of the ABANDONED SHIP
near DEWFORD TOWN...
Don't you dare run around inside
the MUSEUM!
Wow, the submarine's awesome!
I want to go for a ride!
"KANTO WATER QUALITY SAMPLE,"2 the

I'm sorry, the ferry service isn't

Hello, are you here for the ferry?
May I see your TICKET?
LANDON doesn't have the TICKET...
I'm terribly sorry.
You must have a TICKET to board
the ferry.
LANDON flashed the TICKET.
Perfect! That's all you need!
And where would you like to go?
Please sail with us another time!
LILYCOVE CITY it is, then!
BATTLE TOWER it is, then!
Please board the ferry and wait for
departure.
Then, where would you like to go?
A journey to the bottom of the sea...
I wonder what it'd be like?
I'd love to go deep underwater like
that some day.
I wanted to go with CAPT. STERN on
the ocean floor exploration.
But the sub's too small for me.
If I squeezed in, there wouldn't be
any room for the CAPTAIN...
CAPT. STERN: Those thugs...
They're the same lot who tried to rob
the DEVON GOODS at the MUSEUM.
: Fwahahaha...
I commiserate with you!
All that effort you spent following
me here all the way from MT. PYRE.
But now...
No one can stop us! No one!
Or, will you follow us back to our
HIDEOUT in LILYCOVE CITY?
Fwahahahaha...
CAPT. STERN: Why...
Why would TEAM @
 steal my
SUBMARINE EXPLORER 1?
They can't be after the slumbering
POKéMON at the bottom of the sea...
But even if I were to chase them,
I don't stand a chance against them...
CAPT. STERN: Oh, LANDON
...
Okay... So TEAM @
 left before you
could stop them...
Oh, no, don't blame yourself.
You're not responsible for this.
Trying to catch a submarine...
It's impossible for most people.
You would need a POKéMON that knows
how to DIVE...
Perhaps if you went out to
MOSSDEEP CITY...
A lot of divers live out there, so
someone might teach you...

CAPT. STERN: Oh, yes.
MR. BRINEY came to our SHIPYARD.
It won't be long now before we finish
making the ferry!
CAPT. STERN: LANDON
We finally finished making the ferry
S.S. TIDAL!
We couldn't have done it without your
friend MR. BRINEY.
Please go for a short cruise on it!
CAPT. STERN: Oh?
LANDON
, that item you have...
That's a SCANNER! That would sure
help us on our explorations.
LANDON
, would you trade your
SCANNER for something?
Like say a DEEPSEATOOTH or a
DEEPSEASCALE that I have?
CAPT. STERN: Are you certain?
It's useless to you, LANDON
...
Well, okay, then. If you want to trade
your SCANNER, let me know.
CAPT. STERN: So you'll trade it for
my DEEPSEATOOTH?
CAPT. STERN: So you'll trade it for
my DEEPSEASCALE?
CAPT. STERN: Which one do you want?
LANDON handed the SCANNER to
CAPT. STERN.
CAPT. STERN: Thanks, LANDON
This will help our research a lot!
My POKéMON has a HASTY nature.
It has higher SPEED compared to my
other POKéMON.
Maybe their nature has something to
do with the stat gains of POKéMON.
You need a CONTEST PASS to enter a
CONTEST.
It's easy to get. They give it to
anyone who has POKéMON.
Oh, a CONTEST PASS!
You're going to be a contestant?
Want a tip for battling?
I'd say it's raising different kinds
of POKéMON in a balanced manner.
It's no good to make just one
POKéMON strong.
If it has a type disadvantage, it
might not stand a chance.
I trade POKéMON with my friends.
If a traded POKéMON is holding an
item, it makes me twice as happy!
The MARKET does have some interesting
merchandise.
But there are some items you can only
get at a POKé MART.
A GREAT BALL is better than a POKé BALL
at catching POKéMON.
With this, I should be able to get that
elusive POKéMON...
Hey, how's it going, the CHAMPION-
bound LANDON?
WATTSON, the LEADER of MAUVILLE
GYM, uses ELECTRIC-type POKéMON.
If you challenge him with WATER-type
POKéMON, he'll zap them! Bzzt!
And, he's put in switch-controlled doors
all over his GYM! Eccentric!
Hey, go for it!
Whoa, you're electrifying!
You've powered the door open!
My electric soul, it'll shatter your
dreams whole, whoah-yeahah!
That was plugged in, amped up,
over-driven electric, man!
POKéMON and rock, it's all about heart,
whoah yeah!
I trained under WATTSON!
There ain't no way I'd lose easily!
Unplugged and turned off...
WATTSON, our GYM LEADER, has been
around for a long, long time.
He was battling even before your
daddy was born, that tough coot.
This GYM's got puzzles!
Isn't it fun?
It's no fun to lose...
WATTSON says he likes setting up
little traps with switches.
With my charm and my POKéMON's moves,
you'll be shocked!
I'm shocked by your power!
I've heard that MAUVILLE was founded
by WATTSON.
He was a TRAINER long before we
became TRAINERS.=He must know all sorts of things!
I've given up on my plans to convert
the city, I have.
And so, I put my time into making
door traps in my GYM.
Oh? Now, what are you doing here?
What's that? You say you've gotten
past all my rigged doors?
Wahahahah!
Now, that is amusing!
Then, I, WATTSON, the LEADER of
MAUVILLE GYM, shall electrify you!
Wahahahah!
Fine, I lost!
You ended up giving me a thrill!
Take this BADGE!
LANDON received the DYNAMO BADGE
from WATTSON.
With the DYNAMO BADGE, POKéMON can
use ROCK SMASH out of battle.
And, it will make your POKéMON a little
bit faster, too.
Hmm...
You should take this, too!
That TM34 there contains SHOCK WAVE.
It's a trustworthy move that never
misses! You can count on it!
I swell with optimism, seeing a promising
young TRAINER like you!
Wahahahah!
Go forth and endeavor, youngster!
MAUVILLE CITY POKéMON GYM
MAUVILLE CITY POKéMON GYM
WATTSON'S CERTIFIED TRAINERS:
LANDON
Well, well, what have we here?
A most energetic customer!
Me? You may call me RYDEL.
I'm the owner of this cycle shop.
RYDEL: Your RUNNING SHOES...
They're awfully filthy.
Did you come from far away?
RYDEL: Is that right?
Then, I guess you have no need for
any of my BIKES.
RYDEL: Hm, hm... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
You're saying that you came all this
way from LITTLEROOT?
My goodness!
That's ridiculously far!
If you had one of my BIKES, you could
go anywhere easily while feeling the=gentle caress of the wind!
I'll tell you what!
I'll give you a BIKE!
Oh, wait a second!
I forgot to tell you that there are
two kinds of BIKES!
They are the MACH BIKE and the
ACRO BIKE!
MACH BIKE is for cyclists who want
to feel the wind with their bodies!
And an ACRO BIKE is for those who
prefer technical rides!
I'm a real sweetheart, so you can
have whichever one you like!
Which one will you choose?
LANDON chose the MACH BIKE.
LANDON chose the ACRO BIKE.
RYDEL: If you get the urge to switch
BIKES, just come see me!
RYDEL: Oh? Were you thinking about
switching BIKES?
RYDEL: Okay, no problem!
I'll switch BIKES for you!
LANDON got the MACH BIKE exchanged
for an ACRO BIKE.
LANDON got the ACRO BIKE exchanged
for a MACH BIKE.
RYDEL: Good, good!
I'm happy that you like it!
Oh? What happened to that BIKE I
gave you?
Oh, I get it, you stored it using your PC.
Well, take it out of PC storage,
and I'll be happy to exchange it!
May the wind always be at your back
on your adventure!
I'm learning about BIKES while
I work here.
If you need advice on how to ride your
BIKE, there're a couple handbooks in=the back.
It's a handbook on the MACH BIKE.
Which page do you want to read?
A BIKE moves in the direction that
the
 Control Pad is pressed.
It will speed up once it gets rolling.
To stop, release the
 Control Pad.
The BIKE will slow to a stop.
Want to read a different page?
A MACH BIKE is speedy, but it can't
stop very quickly.
It gets a little tricky to get around
a corner.
Release the
 Control Pad a little
before the corner and slow down.
Want to read a different page?
There are small sandy slopes throughout
the HOENN region.
The loose, crumbly sand makes it
impossible to climb normally.
But if you have a MACH BIKE, you can
zip up a sandy slope.
Want to read a different page?
It's a handbook on the ACRO BIKE.
Which page do you want to read?
Press the B Button while riding, and the
front wheel lifts up.
You can zip around with the front
wheel up using the
 Control Pad.
This technique is called a wheelie.
Want to read a different page?
Keeping the B Button pressed, your
BIKE can hop on the spot.
This technique is called a bunny hop.
You can ride while hopping, too.
Want to read a different page?
Press the B Button and the
 Control
Pad at the same time to jump.
Press the
 Control Pad to the side
to jump sideways.
Press it backwards to make the BIKE
change directions while jumping.
Want to read a different page?
Woohoo, your POKéMON look pretty
strong.
I like that!
Here, take this HM!
That HM contains ROCK SMASH.
If you come across large boulders
that block your path...
Well, use that HM move and smash
it right out of your way!
Oh, yes, if you smash a rock, a POKéMON
could come flying out.
This is MAUVILLE GAME CORNER.
Okay, you wanted some COINS for
the games?
But you don't have a COIN CASE for
stowing the COINS.
Were you looking for COINS?
It's $1000 for 50 COINS.
Would you like some?
Thank you very much!
Here are your COINS!
Um... You don't appear to have
enough money...
Oh?
Your COIN CASE is full.
Oh... You don't need COINS, then?
Good luck on your adventure!
It's $1,000 for 50 COINS.
Would you like some?
Welcome.
You can exchange your COINS for
prizes here.
Which prize would you like?
So your choice is @
Thank you!
We'll send it to your PC at home.
You don't have enough COINS.
There isn't any room available for
placing @
Oh, is that so?
You need to save some COINS before=coming back here.
Here you go!
Oh, you can't carry any more than that.
I made a mistake and got two of the
same DOLLS.
Would you like one of them?
There you go!
Huh?
You want it, but not right now?
Oh, don't be so negative!
You can have this!
There's a prize I want, but I can't win
the jackpot.
Hey, kid, if you want to play here,
you need a COIN CASE.
I think the young lady next door
had one. Go see her!
My luck can only last so long.
This is too much for me.=Here, take some COINS!
MAUVILLE has something for
everyone.
For me, it's the GAME CORNER.
The ROULETTE tables have different
rates.
Check your COINS if you're going to
pick a table.
It's easy to lose track of time in here.
I should get back to work.
COINS are needed to play here in the
GAME CORNER.
This ROULETTE thing...
It's rather demanding.
Win or lose, it's only by luck.
Up to three COINS can be used to play
the SLOTS.
It's very difficult to make it stop
right on "7."2
If it stops on "7"2 during the REEL TIME
bonus game, you'll receive extra COINS.
Here's some information for you
about the SLOTS.
The more lightning bolts you stock, the
more REEL TIME chances you get.
In a game with the maximum five REEL
TIME chances...
It is possible to receive four regular
bonuses, then a big bonus.
The big bonus is 660 COINS, but it's
very difficult to get.
You can't play if you don't have a
COIN CASE.
If I had a BIKE, it'd be easy to cycle to
SLATEPORT for some shopping.
I'd be able to buy HARBOR MAIL at the
POKéMON MART in SLATEPORT...
Oh! You have HARBOR MAIL?
Will you trade it for a COIN CASE?
Oh, I'm so happy!
Okay, I'll trade you a COIN CASE!
That COIN CASE can be used at the
GAME CORNER.
Oh, that's disappointing.
A COIN CASE is needed for the
GAME CORNER.
That man over there, he says weird
things!
He's funny in a weird way.
I doubt I'll forget about him!
When I accessed the RECORD CORNER,
the data for what's hot in DEWFORD=got updated.
Now that bit of data is the same
as my friend's!
A RECORD CORNER opened upstairs in
the POKéMON CENTER.
I don't know what it's about, but it
sounds fun. I'll go check it out!
Did you know that you can link battle
at the COLOSSEUM here?
They put up your record on the wall
for everyone to see.
It's embarrassing if you lose more
often than you win...
There are items that temporarily
elevate the stats of POKéMON.
The ones I know you use in battle
are X ATTACK and X DEFEND...
I do believe that there are others
like them.
Use a certain move, or use an item
instead...
The TRAINER's decisions determine how
battles turn out, I think.
Hello and welcome to the DEVON
CORPORATION.
We're proud producers of items and
medicine that enhance your life.
One of our research staff stupidly
got robbed of an important parcel.
Hey, those RUNNING SHOES!
They're one of our products!
It makes me happy when I see someone
using something we made.
That stolen parcel...
Well, sure it's important, but it's not
anything that anyone can use.
In my estimation, that robber must not
have been very bright.
It sounds like they've recovered
the ripped-off DEVON GOODS.
I'm sorry, only authorized people
are allowed to enter here.
It's beyond stupid.
How could we get robbed?
Hi, there!
You're always welcome here!
We're developing a device for talking
with POKéMON.
But we haven't had much success...
I'm developing new kinds of
POKé BALLS...
But I haven't made much headway...
We finally made new kinds of POKé BALLS!
The REPEAT BALL makes it easier to
catch POKéMON you'd caught before.
The TIMER BALL gets better at catching
POKéMON the longer a battle runs.
Both are proudly developed by the
DEVON CORPORATION.
Please give them a try!
I made the POKéNAV!
As an engineer, I feel blessed to have
made something so great!
Oh, wow!
That's a POKéNAV!
It came about as a result of our
PRESIDENT's desire to learn about=the feelings of POKéMON.
Would you like me to describe its
features in detail?
No, no. I think you'll find out just by
trying the POKéNAV out.
I'm trying to develop a device that
visually reproduces the dreams of=POKéMON...
But it's not going well.
I've been trying to develop a device
that resurrects POKéMON from fossils...
And, it's working!
Wait! That thing you have there...
Is that a POKéMON fossil?
Would you like to bring that POKéMON
back to life?
I can with my newly developed
FOSSIL REGENERATOR.
Oh, is that so?
DEVON's technological expertise
is outstanding, I tell you.
Excellent!
Let's do this right away.
LANDON handed the @
 to
the DEVON RESEARCHER.
The FOSSIL REGENERATOR, which I made,
is incredible.
But it has one drawback - it takes
a long time to work.
So, uh... How about you go for a stroll
and look around for a while?
Thanks for waiting!
Your fossilized POKéMON has been
brought back to life!
The fossil was an ancient POKéMON.
, it was!
LANDON received @
 from
the DEVON RESEARCHER.
Uh-oh, you've got too many POKéMON.
You have no room for this one.
I'm MR. STONE, the PRESIDENT of
the DEVON CORPORATION.
I'd just got word about you!
You saved our staff not just once,
but twice!
I have a favor to ask of an amazing
person like you.
I understand that you're delivering
a package to SLATEPORT's SHIPYARD.
Well, on the way, could you stop off in
DEWFORD TOWN?
I was hoping that you'd deliver a LETTER
to STEVEN in DEWFORD.
MR. STONE: Now, you should know that
I am a great PRESIDENT.
So, I'd never be so cheap as to ask
a favor for nothing in return.
That's why I want you to have this!
LANDON received a POKéNAV.
MR. STONE: That device...
It's a POKéMON NAVIGATOR, or POKéNAV
for short.
It's an indispensable tool for any
TRAINER on an adventure.
It has a map of the HOENN region.
You can check the locations of
DEWFORD and SLATEPORT easily!
MR. STONE: I'm counting on you!
MR. STONE: You delivered my LETTER?
Thank you kindly!
This is my way of thanking you.
It should help you, a TRAINER.
MR. STONE: A POKéMON holding that
EXP. SHARE will be given some of the=EXP Points from battle.
It will get EXP Points even if it didn't
actually battle.
I would say EXP. SHARE is quite useful
for raising weak POKéMON.
MR. STONE: Since my youth, I've immersed
myself in work.
Consequently, I'm not familiar with
trends and that sort of thing.
But do young people all want to be
TRAINERS in the POKéMON LEAGUE?
This is the DEVON CORPORATION's
third floor.
Our PRESIDENT's OFFICE is on this floor.
Anyway, I can't tell you how much I'm
grateful for what you've done.
Um... By the way, that parcel you got
back for us...
Could I get you to deliver that to the
SHIPYARD in SLATEPORT?
It would be awful if those robbers
tried to take it again.
Uh... Hehehe, so, uh, could I count
on you to do that for me?
Oh, that's right.
Could you wait here a second?
Our PRESIDENT would like to have
a word with you.
Please come with me.
Please, go ahead.
If you visit the SHIPYARD in SLATEPORT,
you should go see CAPT. STERN.
DEVON's new products, the REPEAT BALL
and TIMER BALL, have become hugely=popular among TRAINERS.
It's a collection of rare rocks and
stones assembled by the PRESIDENT.
Yo, how's it going?
Listen, my friend!
Would you like to become the CHAMPION?
I'm no TRAINER, not me, but I can
sure give you winning advice.
That's settled, then! We'll aim for the
POKéMON CHAMPIONSHIP together!
It's your job as a TRAINER to collect
GYM BADGES, am I right?
But GYM LEADERS aren't pushovers!
And that's where I come in!
I'm here to provide expert advice!
ROXANNE, the GYM LEADER, is a user
of ROCK-type POKéMON.
The ROCK type is very durable, but
it can't stand WATER-type and=GRASS-type moves.
Come see me afterwards, if you beat
the GYM LEADER.
Well, go for it!
Whoa! What a breathtaking victory!
My cheering must've worked!
Great!
Check your TRAINER CARD.
The STONE BADGE you got should be
properly recorded on it.
In other words...
You've climbed the first step on
the stairs to the CHAMPIONSHIP!
That's got to feel awesome!
Don't take us GYM TRAINERS lightly!
I'll show you why we're better!
You were too good for me...
You haven't seen anything of the ROCK
type's terrifying power!
If you can't beat me, you won't stand
a chance against ROXANNE!
Wow! You've got some potential!
ROXANNE is stronger than me by
several times.
You'd better be on your guard!
Hello, I am ROXANNE, the RUSTBORO
POKéMON GYM LEADER.
I became a GYM LEADER so that I may
apply what I learned at the POKéMON=TRAINER'S SCHOOL in battle.
Would you kindly demonstrate how you
battle, and with which POKéMON?
So...
I lost...
It seems that I still have much more
to learn...
I understand.
The POKéMON LEAGUE's rules state
that TRAINERS are to be given this=if they defeat a GYM LEADER.
Please accept the official POKéMON
LEAGUE STONE BADGE.
LANDON received the STONE BADGE
from ROXANNE.
The STONE BADGE heightens the ATTACK
power of your POKéMON.
It also enables them to use the HM move
CUT outside of battle.
Please take this with you, too.
That TM39 contains ROCK TOMB.
It not only inflicts damage by dropping
rocks, it also lowers SPEED.
If you use a TM, it instantly teaches
the move to a POKéMON.
Remember, a TM can be used only once,
so think before you use it.
Since you are so strong, you should
challenge other GYM LEADERS.
By battling many TRAINERS, you should
learn many things.

ROXANNE'S CERTIFIED TRAINERS:

The blackboard lists status changes
that may affect POKéMON in battle.
Which topic do you want to read?
If a POKéMON is poisoned, it will
steadily lose HP.
The effects of poison remain after
a battle.
A poisoned POKéMON's HP will drop
while it is traveling.
Heal a poisoning using an ANTIDOTE.
If a POKéMON becomes paralyzed,
its SPEED drops.
It may also not be able to move while
it is in battle.
Paralysis remains after battle.
Cure it using a PARLYZ HEAL.
If a POKéMON falls asleep, it will be
unable to attack.
A POKéMON may wake up on its own,
but if a battle ends while it is sleeping,=it will stay asleep.
Wake it up using an AWAKENING.
A burn reduces ATTACK power, and it
steadily reduces the victim's HP.
A burn lingers after battle.
Cure a burn using a BURN HEAL.
If a POKéMON is frozen, it becomes
completely helpless.
It will remain frozen after battle.
Thaw it out using an ICE HEAL.
Students who don't study get a little
taste of my QUICK CLAW.
Whether or not you are a good student
will be evident from the way you use=this item.
A POKéMON holding the QUICK CLAW will
occasionally speed up and get to move=before its opponent.
There are many other items that are
meant to be held by POKéMON.
Just those alone will give you many
topics to study!
I'm trading POKéMON with my friend
right now.
I always wanted a SEEDOT, and
I'm finally getting one!
POKéMON can hold items, but they
don't know what to do with man-made=items like POTION and ANTIDOTE.
You know how some POKéMON moves can
confuse a POKéMON?
A confused POKéMON will sometimes
attack itself without meaning to.
But once it leaves battle, it will
return to normal.
A POKéMON holding a BERRY will heal
itself...
There are many kinds of items that
POKéMON can hold...
Boy, it sure is hard taking notes
down...
It's this student's notebook...
POKéMON are to be caught using
POKé BALLS.
Up to six POKéMON can accompany
a TRAINER.
A TRAINER is someone who catches
POKéMON, raises them, and battles=with them.
A TRAINER's mission is to defeat the
strong TRAINERS who await challengers=in POKéMON GYMS.
My POKéMON has a NAIVE nature, and my
friend's has a JOLLY nature.
It's fascinating how POKéMON have
personalities!
Just like people, there are male and
female POKéMON.
But no one seems to have any idea how
they're different.
The man next door gave me an HM!
I used it to teach my POKéMON how to
CUT down skinny trees.
I'm buying some PARLYZ HEALS and
ANTIDOTES.
Just in case I run into SHROOMISH
in PETALBURG WOODS.
My POKéMON evolved.
It has a lot of HP now.
I should buy SUPER POTIONS for it
instead of ordinary POTIONS.
I'm getting an ESCAPE ROPE just in
case I get lost in a cave.
I just need to use it to get back to the
entrance.
Every POKéMON has a special ability
that it can use.
POKéMON are such strange creatures.
Oh, it's so hard every day...
What's hard?
You need to ask?
It's trying to figure out what to
make for meals every day.
It really isn't easy coming up with
meals every day.
Do you nickname your POKéMON?
I gave a cool name to mine.
But when I call my POKéMON by that
name, people laugh at me...
If it's okay with you, want to trade
your @
 for my @
Eheheheh, ooh, this is so exciting!
But that's no @
Tch, that's so disappointing...
Aww, it's a good POKéMON...
Don't you get curious about what other
people named their POKéMON?
In all sorts of places, there are all
sorts of POKéMON and people.
I find that fascinating, so I go to all
sorts of places.
That determined expression...
That limber way you move...=And your well-trained POKéMON...
You're obviously a skilled TRAINER!
No, wait, don't say a word.
I can tell just by looking at you.
I'm sure that you will be capable
of putting this HM to good use.
No need to be modest or shy.
Go on, take it!
That HM, it's CUT.
An HM move is one that can be used
by POKéMON out of a battle.
Any POKéMON that's learned CUT can
chop down thin trees if the TRAINER=has earned the STONE BADGE.
And, unlike a TM, an HM doesn't break
after one use.
When they were expanding the city of
RUSTBORO, my dad helped out.
He made his POKéMON use CUT to clear
the land of trees.
The TRAINER'S SCHOOL is excellent.
If you study there, you could even
become a GYM LEADER.
ROXANNE, the GYM LEADER, really knows
a lot about POKéMON.
She's really strong, too!
DEVON CORPORATION's workers live in
this building.
SKITTY: Gyaaaah!
Way back in the old days, DEVON was just
a teeny, tiny company.
My daddy's working at the CORPORATION.
My daddy made this!
But I can't use it, so you can have it.
My daddy's working at the CORPORATION.
When I grow up, I'm going to work for
DEVON, too.
DEVON's PRESIDENT likes to collect
rare stones.
I think the PRESIDENT's son also
collects rare stones.
For my own POKéMON, I give them
perfectly suited nicknames!
It's my expression of, uh...
originality, yes, that's it!
But giving the name PEKACHU to a
PIKACHU? It seems pointless.
I suppose it is good to use a name
that's easy to understand, but...
PEKACHU: Peka!
Hi, there's this POKéMON that I'm
looking for.
I want a @
Do you have one?
Would you trade it for my @
Thank you!
I'll be good to your @
so please be nice to my @
Wait!
That POKéMON isn't a @
I guess you don't want to trade
with me.
Oh, okay. If you change your mind,
please come see me.
I'll be waiting!
Thank you for trading with me!
I really wanted this POKéMON, so
I promise to take good care of it!
Trading POKéMON with others...
It's as if you're trading your own
memories with other people.
ZIGZAGOON: Gumomoh?
Yo, how's it going, CHAMPION-
bound LANDON?
FORTREE GYM LEADER WINONA is a
master of FLYING-type POKéMON.
She's waiting at the back of this GYM,
behind the rotating doors.
She's waiting for new challengers who
are trying to take wing!
Okay, go for it!
You did it!
You've achieved liftoff!
Behold the elegant battle style of
BIRD POKéMON!
You...
You're strong...
A TRAINER has to be smart to keep
up with unexpected turns of events.
Let's see if you have the smarts to
get to our LEADER?
The lovers of BIRD POKéMON aspire
to join this GYM.
As a member of the FORTREE GYM,
I'm not allowed to lose!
It was too much of a load for me
to bear...
The world is huge, and there are
countless tough TRAINERS.
I'm going to keep training and make
myself even stronger.
There's no need for WINONA, our GYM
LEADER, to deal with you!
I'm plenty good enough for you!
WINONA, I...
I lost!
WINONA is cute and she's strong.
She's the ultimate LEADER!
Blush...
WINONA taught me personally!
You can't beat me easily!
I was beaten...
Thanks to WINONA, the people of
FORTREE can live without fear.
I am WINONA. I am the LEADER of the
FORTREE POKéMON GYM.
I have become one with BIRD POKéMON
and have soared the skies...
However grueling the battle, we have
triumphed with grace...
Witness the elegant choreography
of BIRD POKéMON and I!
Never before have I seen a TRAINER
command POKéMON with more grace=than I...
In recognition of your prowess,
I present to you this GYM BADGE.
LANDON received the FEATHER BADGE
from WINONA.
With the FEATHER BADGE, all POKéMON up
to LV 70, even those received through=trades, will obey your every command.
You will also be able to use the
HM move FLY outside of battle.
And this...
This is a gift from me.
TM40 contains AERIAL ACE.
Its speed...
No POKéMON should be able to avoid it.
Though I fell to you, I will remain
devoted to BIRD POKéMON.

LANDON
Listen, kid, are you working
on a POKéDEX?
Hmm... Go to the SAFARI ZONE.
That's my suggestion.
Have you done anything at the
RECORD CORNER?
It's pretty neat. It mixes and matches
the records of TRAINERS.
I don't know quite how it works,
but it's cool. It's exciting, even!
Hey, you've got a POKéNAV!
It's the same as mine.
Check out the TRAINER'S EYES on it.
It shows you TRAINERS who want a
rematch with you.
Isn't it great?
You have to hand it to DEVON!
SUPER REPEL lasts a long time, and
it gets the job done.
It's much better than an ordinary
REPEL.
I always stock up on more items than
I'm sure I'll need.
You never know what might happen.
Better to be safe than sorry!
A RARE CANDY makes a POKéMON grow
immediately by one level.
People... POKéMON...
Their hidden powers are aroused by
living in natural environments...
Let this old woman see if your hidden
power has awoken...
I hold a coin in my hand.
Now, tell me, have I palmed it in the
right hand? Or in the left?
Oh! Yes, correct!
We shall try again.
In which hand have I palmed the coin?
The right or left?
Oh! Yes, correct again!
We shall try once more.
In which hand have I palmed the coin?
The right or left? Choose!
Oh! Splendid!
Your hidden power has awoken!
Here, take this and awaken the hidden
power of your POKéMON.
HIDDEN POWER is a move that changes
with the POKéMON.
No, too bad.
You guessed wrong.
The area around FORTREE CITY is like
a jungle.
It gets awfully tiring walking around
this city.
That's why I use FLY to instantly go to
any city I've visited.
Speaking of POKéDEXES, I remembered
something.
I met this TRAINER, STEVEN, when
I was searching for rare stones.
Hoo, boy, he had some amazing POKéMON
with him.
They weren't just rare, they were
trained to terrifying extremes!
He might even be stronger than the
GYM LEADER in this town...
What's that thing you have there?
... ... ... ... ... ...
Oh, it's called a POKéDEX?
It's really awesome!
By being together with POKéMON,
people make more and more friends.
And that brings the world closer
together. I think it's wonderful!
There!
Go, BIRD POKéMON!
Heheh, I asked my WINGULL to run an
errand for me.
Good!
Welcome back, WINGULL!
Huh? What is this?
What is it holding?
A MENTAL HERB?
It must have picked it up somewhere.
But I'm not a TRAINER, so you can
have it.
Thanks to my WINGULL, I have friends
who live far away.
WINGULL: Pihyoh!
The tree houses of FORTREE are great!
I think it's the number one town for
living together with POKéMON.
POKéMON and people have adapted to
nature to survive.
There's no need to make nature
conform to the way we want to live.
ZIGZAGOON: Bufuu!
Merchandise you buy here is sent to
your own PC.
That's fantastic! I wish they could
also deliver me home like that.
I'm buying a pretty desk and I'm
putting my cute DOLLS on it.
If I don't, when I decorate my
SECRET BASE, my DOLLS will get=dirty or poked with splinters.
Hm, so they doubled the guests by
using POKéMON as attractions?
Hm, well, maybe I should make a cute
POKéMON our inn's mascot.
I wonder if that will attract more
guests to stay with us?
Oh, sorry, sorry!
I was too involved in watching TV!
Since that TEAM @
 came to town,
the tourists have been staying away.
Hey, down in front!
I can't see the TV!
Amazing! You're telling me a POKéMON
found someone's lost item?
That's something. If we had some smart
POKéMON like that...
We could recover anything that our
guests mislaid...
Oh, sorry, sorry!
I was too involved in watching TV!
I heard that someone busted the
TEAM @
 HIDEOUT.
Thanks to that, we just booked a
reservation from a big group.
It was a company called... Uh...
GAME something...
Amazing! A house-sitting POKéMON
caught a burglar?
That's something. If we had a tough
POKéMON as a security guard...
We would be able to provide our guests
with greater safety.
Oh, sorry, sorry!
I was too involved in watching TV.
Oh, yes. A big group of guests arrived
a little while ago.
They booked in as GAME FREAK, so I
guess they must make games.
Uh-oh, I'd better get working on
their dinner!
I'm the GAME DESIGNER.
Oh, is that right?
You're working on a POKéDEX?
It's tough trying to complete it,
but don't give up.
If you do complete it, please come
show me.
Wow! That's awesome!
Yep, it's totally awesome!
This POKéDEX is completely filled!
You really must love POKéMON!
I'm so impressed!
Let me give you something in
recognition of your feat!
Me? You're talking to me?
I'm the PROGRAMMER.
I wonder what the SLOTS are
like here.
I'm the GRAPHIC ARTIST! Aren't the
POKéMON of HOENN interesting?
The girl TUBERS, they're cute, hey?
To battle against a cute TUBER...
Whoop, it drives me wild!
And the TWINS! Aren't they cute?
A 2-on-2 battle with TWINS...
Whoop, it's unbearably fun!
The sea breeze tickles my heart.
It feels wonderful here!
You never know when and where
people will challenge you.
That's why I never leave home without
my GAME BOY ADVANCE.
Welcome to LILYCOVE MUSEUM.
Please take the time to enjoy our
collection of fantastic artwork=featuring POKéMON.
I'm the CURATOR of this MUSEUM of
fine arts.
It's heartening to see someone so
young as you in our MUSEUM.
Have you viewed our collection of
paintings already?
Ah, then let me not disturb you.
Please, do take your time.
Oh? I do believe that you seem to
be a POKéMON TRAINER.
Have you an interest in paintings,
too?
I see...
I'm honored that you would visit
us in spite of that.
Ah, excellent!
You do like paintings!
Then, may I ask you to come with me?
It's a very old painting.
The paint is peeling here and there.
It's an odd landscape with bizarre
and fantastic scenery.
It's a painting of a beautiful, smiling
woman with a POKéMON on her lap.
It's a painting of a legendary POKéMON
from long ago.
The artist painted this from
imagination.
It's a painting of GRASS POKéMON
swaying in a breeze.
They appear to be enjoying the wind's
gentle caress.
It's a delicious-looking painting
of BERRIES.
This painting could make you hungry!
It's a replica of a famous sculpture.
It depicts an ancient BIRD POKéMON.
It's a big POKé BALL carved from a
black stone.
It was apparently used in festivals
in the olden days.
It's a huge stone tablet inscribed
with POKéMON and dense text in the=small characters of an ancient,=unreadable language.
Hmmm...
What works of great magnificence...
Battling with POKéMON is fun,
I'll grant you that.
But one mustn't forget our love for
the fine arts.
This ART MUSEUM... Well, you could
see many fantastic paintings.
And the CURATOR is a wonderful person.
Among artists like myself, this MUSEUM
is an inspiration.
This lady is pretty!
She's like Mommy!
This POKéMON is adorable!
Just like our little boy!
I'd heard that this ART MUSEUM got
in some new paintings.
So, naturally I hurried over.
Are the new paintings up on the
second floor?
Lately, the CURATOR has been
unusually cheerful.
I bet something good happened for him.
Definitely.
I aim to see many great paintings
here and learn from them.
I have this dream of one day having
my artwork exhibited here.
The ART MUSEUM has become a favorite
tourist destination.
It's great for LILYCOVE...
No, great for the HOENN region!
This is what I've heard - a lone TRAINER
procured all the paintings upstairs.
This is our special exhibit hall.
As you can plainly see, there is not a
single painting on exhibit.
Here, I don't wish to exhibit works of
so-called classical art.
Such classical works you can see on
our ground floor.
I wish to exhibit work that is far
different from the classics.
Art, after all, is not restricted to old,
famous works!
This exhibit hall, I wish to fill it with...
Modern and vibrant artworks of
POKéMON seemingly ready to spring=forth into glorious life!
I beg your pardon. I didn't intend
to monopolize the conversation.
Now, as you are young, and yet
obviously well traveled...
You must encounter lively POKéMON
and works of art depicting them.
If you were to come across such a
painting, may we ask you to obtain=the artist's permission to exhibit=it here?
I wish to fill this exhibit hall with
modern and vibrant paintings of=POKéMON.
Thanks to you, we've added a new
painting to our collection!
I've heard it depicts your POKéMON.
Truly magnificent!
Thank you so very, very much!
Ah! It's you!
LANDON!
Isn't this marvelous?
This collection of paintings!
Each one of them flawless!
None better than another!
These paintings have attracted
more guests to our ART MUSEUM.
Sincerely, I thank you, LANDON.
This is my dream come true!
This is merely a token of my gratitude.
LANDON received a GLASS ORNAMENT.
I will keep this for you until we
meet again.
Ah, so good to see you, LANDON!
It's an honor to have you visit us
on your busy journeys.
Please, relax and do enjoy your
visit with us.
It's a picture frame with pink-colored
adornments.
It's a picture frame with yellow-colored
adornments.
It's a picture frame with blue-colored
adornments.
It's a picture frame with red-colored
adornments.
It's a picture frame with green-colored
adornments.
It's a painting of POKéMON.
I've been away awhile, so the new
paintings up here surprised me.
I wish someone would paint my POKéMON
this pretty.
Well... So this is where they show the
topical POKéMON paintings.
I see, these new paintings are indeed
rather amusing.
Wow, is that right?
These paintings are of your POKéMON.
Isn't that just the ultimate joy for
a TRAINER?

Congratulations!
I did a painting of your POKéMON to
commemorate its victory...
Well, your POKéMON's appeals were
so fantastic, it spurred me into=painting better than I usually do.=Look, see?
The screen switches to display the
painting.
What do you think? I'm confident in
what I've done, but do you like it?
A work of this caliber, it wouldn't look
out of place in an art museum.
Huh? An art museum really is looking
for paintings?
Do you think I should take this there?
What, really? Then, sure, I will take
this painting there right now.
I'll give it a proper title, too.
I hope they'll like it and consider
exhibiting this.
Please check if they did accept this.
Thank you!
Oh, that's right!
As a memento of me painting your
POKéMON, please take this.
LANDON received a RIBBON.
LANDON put the RIBBON on
Okay, see you!
Oh... Then, I guess I'll just take
this home with me...
But, you know, I would like to take
this to the art museum... Okay?
Oh, fine, that's the way it is.
I will hang this in my own house.
I'll just have to try harder next time.
Well, be seeing you.
Hoo, boy... Master Rank CONTESTS,
here I come.
The world will know that my dearest
POKéMON is the cutest being in all=existence. The time has come!=Uheheheh.
You can see a whole variety of
POKéMON here.
That's why I make this place a regular
part of my daily stroll.
Oh, dear! They still haven't given
you a CONTEST PASS?
You should go get one in VERDANTURF
TOWN right away.
It's such a thrill having others see
POKéMON that you've raised with care=and love.
When you get up to the Master Rank
CONTESTS, you get your eyes opened=to striking POKéMON that just scream=to be painted.
The TOUGHNESS CONTEST is like
extreme, man!
Those muscular appeals...
Cascading sweat... I swoon!
Day in and day out, I lavished my care
on this POKéMON.
Its condition is peaking.
Today, victory is mine!
I made
S with Mom, Dad and
Big Sister. They turned out great!
I bet you can make smoother, better
S if you have more people.
This POKéMON won the BEAUTY CONTEST
here before.
Well, guess what? Today, I made it
win a SMARTNESS CONTEST!
My abilities scare even me...
I've entered a bunch of CONTESTS,
so I'm seeing how things work.
If you're in a COOLNESS CONTEST,
cool moves go over as appeals.
But smart moves and cute moves
don't go over well, for instance.
That young man who won earlier had
a whole bunch of different
Can you win if you had that many
of those things?
Whoa, isn't this place humongous!
The tension in the air... It's not
like a CONTEST hall in the sticks.
MC: Okay, SMART POKéMON and their
TRAINERS, are you ready?!
Give it your best showing!
Let's appeal!
JUDGE: Are you enjoying this CONTEST?
Come back with three friends, and
all of you may enter a CONTEST!
Ayayayay...
I entered the wrong CONTEST.
I entered this tough POKéMON in the
SMARTNESS CONTEST...
Come on, wow them with a smart-looking
ROCK SMASH.
I've spent many a year, and all my
wisdom besides, raising this POKéMON=to be smart.
It won't be easily bested by some
young pup's POKéMON.
My dear wife, are you seeing this?
There it is!
If my POKéMON pulls a smart move next,
the audience's excitement will peak!
Oh, dear, no!
My darling ZUBAT's LEECH LIFE is so
cute I kept using it over and over!
But these mean people don't appreciate
it at all!
Kiyaaah! You're beautiful, Grandpa!
Even when TRAINERS enter the same
kind of POKéMON, they all seem to use=different moves for appeals.
It's just like the way people have
different styles for battling.
I think the POKéMON look smarter
than their TRAINERS. By a lot.
When all's said and done, I still love
SMARTNESS CONTESTS.
That intellectual green color...
It's so... So... Cool.
MC: Are you entering the BEAUTY
CONTEST, too? Good luck!
JUDGE: Ah, every POKéMON here is a
model of pristine beauty!
Why, I almost forgot to score them!
A POKéMON this beautiful...
There isn't another one like it.
Everyone's eyes will be glued to
my beauty.
Waaaah!
I brushed and groomed my POKéMON
carefully for this CONTEST...
But I overdid it...
My POKéMON's coat turned all scraggly...
What should I do?
This AURORA BEAM is so dazzling,
the JUDGE won't be able to see it.
Uh, wait a second...
That'll be meaningless, then!
This pretty POKéMON looks just like
me when I was younger.
Right when I said that, my husband
spewed the coffee he was drinking.
Did I say something funny?
You know, as a woman, if I win at a
BEAUTY CONTEST, sure it makes me=happy. More than usual, anyway.
Wahahahah!
Will you take a gander at all those
pretty POKéMON!=I just love this sort of glitz!
You can't always win on just beauty
alone.
You have to groom your POKéMON so
it's nice and glossy like mine.
MC: Uh-oh! Hello!
We're in the middle of a CONTEST!
Please enter at our registration
counter and come out, okay?
JUDGE: Oh, such charming and cute
appeals!
Oh, my goodness! What a perfectly
adorable WATER SPORT appeal!
Oh, no... My sweet AZURILL was
distracted by another POKéMON.
My POKéMON has never won in a battle,
but put it in a CONTEST and look out!
My POKéMON's PETAL DANCE is a marvel
of elegance.
I won't let anyone disturb its
performance.
Everyone's POKéMON are very cute.
However, if my POKéMON were to make
a cute appeal...
I'm sure that it would be so much
cuter than the others.
My child is in this CONTEST.
Come on, dear. Go for it!
Your POKéMON is the best!
I think that girl over there is the
cutest of the lot.
What's that? They're judging
POKéMON by their looks?
Ohh, seeing all these cute POKéMON,
they make we want to get my own!
I'm going to go catch some!
COOLNESS CONTEST STAGE
BE CHILLED BY COOL POKéMON!
BEAUTY CONTEST STAGE
BE ALLURED BY BEAUTIFUL POKéMON!
CUTENESS CONTEST STAGE
BE CHARMED BY CUTE POKéMON!
SMARTNESS CONTEST STAGE
BE IMPRESSED BY SMART POKéMON!
TOUGHNESS CONTEST STAGE
BE THRILLED BY TOUGH POKéMON!
I wonder how many kinds of POKéMON
there are in the world?
It'd be great to cross seas and
trade POKéMON with people far away.
I've been hearing about some rotten
scoundrels who steal POKéMON and rip=off METEORITES.
Those rotten scoundrels who steal
POKéMON and rip off METEORITES...
I haven't seen them around recently.
I'm going to get X ATTACK to raise
ATTACK during battle.
That way, I'll be guaranteed to win!
FULL HEAL is a little expensive,
but it is convenient.
Just one of these can cure any
POKéMON status problem.
Oh, wow!
It's LANDON!
I've heard the news!
You're really strong, aren't you?
We always argue about who is the
strongest of all TRAINERS here.
So when I heard about you, I decided
to be your fan!
I hope you'll keep on battling other
tough TRAINERS.
That way, we'll be able to see more
of your hot, hot battles.
That will make the others here see
exactly how great you are.
Remember, I'm cheering for you,
LANDON!
Yo, LANDON!
You're the one we want to win!
The others, they don't know that
you're the best of the best!
Isn't that right, LANDON?
Show them you've got guts!
I hate to say this, but the TRAINER
everybody's talking about is=@
, no question about it!
That TRAINER's power...
It's out of the ordinary.
Darn it... I've been telling people
that @
 is the best now...
But no one wants to listen...
I've been hearing things about a
tough new TRAINER.
This TRAINER's supposed to be beating
GYM LEADERS, even.
Do you know anything about this
new TRAINER?
Oh!
LANDON!
Go for it!
I'm pulling for you!
Sigh...
BRAWLY...
Oh, no! Wait!
That's not right! No, no, no!
I'm your fan through and through!
So make me proud!
Go for it!
I can't help it, I can only get to
like BRAWLY...
Nobody understands the charm of
BRAWLY...
I don't care!
Even if I'm the only one, I'm going
to keep cheering for BRAWLY!
Whatever anyone says, my favorite
TRAINER is DEWFORD's GYM LEADER=BRAWLY!
You've surpassed your own father in
every regard!
I'm telling you, so there's no question
about it at all!
Even when things turned bleak, your
father never gave up.
This I know to be true.
You never give up even if you lose!
So keep on battling!
NORMAN battled with more power,
charisma, and showmanship than you.
Even though people may say that
you're strong...
You've still got a long way to go
compared to your father.
You're beginning to get the same
air of awe NORMAN exudes.
But there's something conclusively
different between you and NORMAN.
I can't tell you what that is.
You'll have to find it yourself.
Everyone here, we're all huge fans
of POKéMON battles.
We discuss who we consider to be
the strongest of all TRAINERS.
If you were to become famous, we
might even become your fans!
Oh, woweee! It's LANDON!
For real, too!
Please, shake my hand, shake my hand!
I'll always cheer for you, LANDON!
Always, always!
I don't want to see you lose ever,
LANDON.
Because I know you're really, really
strong, LANDON!
 is really cool...
Everyone thinks so, right, right?
 really is cool, don't
you think so?
Even if it's just me, I'm going to keep
cheering my favorite TRAINER.
My favorite TRAINER is...
Cool...
Strong...
And really nice...
I wish there was a TRAINER like that...
Whoa! It's LANDON!
Wicked!
When I grow up, I want to be strong
like you, LANDON!
Even if I'm the only one...
You'll always be the only one I
cheer for, LANDON!
Because I believe in you, LANDON!
 is so wickedly cool...
I want to shake hands with my hero.
Even if I'm the only one...
I'm never going to stop being
's fan!
Because I've heard, @
never loses!
LANDON!
You are amazing after all!
Ever since I set eyes on you, I knew
that you were great.
It looks like my eyes didn't deceive me.
Who cares about the others.
I'm in your corner!
You don't need to worry. Just get
out there and battle like always.
You're a pretty decent TRAINER,
I think.
But I also think that @
is number one right now.
That's just my opinion.
Don't worry about it too much.
Wow, you really are strong.
Maybe even stronger than @
But @
 needs me.
If I don't cheer for @
who will?
You've changed my mind!
You are strong, aren't you?
I'd like you to tell me how you managed
to get so strong!
The tougher the situation, the more
attractively you battle.
I can't wait for your next battle!
Among the recently hot TRAINERS,
 is the standout.
That toughness, it's simply not normal.
You're doing okay, but you're not in
the same class as @
You are really popular...
You're strong, and you're caring to
POKéMON. No one can knock you.
But, you know, I believe in @
 is definitely stronger!
I'm positive!
You...
Impressive!
Your true worth, it is fine if only
I recognized it.
The others I doubt will understand
the hidden power that beats within.
Yes, I see strength in your eyes.
But!
You still haven't realized your
potential.
It is true that you are tremendously
powerful.
But!
I can tell...
That strength cannot be considered
true strength yet!
True strength is...!
... ...
Actually, I have no idea, either.
I beg your pardon?
You're looking for a ship?
I'm sorry, the ferry service isn't
available at present...
Hello, are you here for the ferry?
May I see your TICKET?
LANDON doesn't have the TICKET...
I'm terribly sorry.
You must have a TICKET to board
the ferry.
LANDON flashed the TICKET.
Perfect! That's all you need!
And where would you like to go?
Please sail with us another time!
SLATEPORT CITY it is, then!
BATTLE TOWER it is, then!
Please board the ferry and wait for
departure.
Then, where would you like to go?
Until they finish making the ferry, we
sailors have nothing to do...
I wish they'd get a move on, the folks
at the SHIPYARD in SLATEPORT.
The ferry S.S. TIDAL is finally in
operation.
The folks at the SHIPYARD in SLATEPORT
must've worked extra hard.
Well, it's my turn to get busy now!
Uh...
Oh, yes, I'm the MOVE DELETER.
I can make POKéMON forget their moves.
Would you like me to do that?
Which POKéMON should forget a move?
Which move should be forgotten?

Hm! @

That move should be forgotten?
It worked to perfection!

 completely.
Come again if there are other moves

What?
No EGG should know any moves.
POKéMON are partners to people.
They aren't our tools.
Unfortunately, there are some people
who fail to understand that...
KECLEON: Ruroro?
Huh? What? What's that?
I'm not near awake yet...
You can have this...
Yawn...
Sleep is essential for good health...

The lower the feel rating,

When my wife gave birth to quadruplets,
you bet I was shocked.
But, now, seeing them play together,
it makes me happy.
We're having MULTI BATTLES, but I know
I'm going to win.
We like mixing stuff at the RECORD
CORNER.
But what gets mixed up?
We're going to make super
with a BERRY BLENDER!
I want to brag about how tough my
POKéMON is, so we're going to enter a=CONTEST together.
This planet's biggest mysteries are
at the bottom of the sea.
Somebody said that, but I don't know...
There's a deep underwater trench
between MOSSDEEP and SOOTOPOLIS.
That's what someone told me, anyway.
Welcome to LILYCOVE DEPARTMENT STORE.
Whenever I come to the DEPARTMENT
STORE, I always end up buying all sorts=of things because it's so fun.
Today, my mom is going to buy me some
nice furniture.

I'm leaving on a long journey soon.
I need to stock up on items.
FOR YOUR TRAVELING COMPANIONS
2F: TRAINER'S ZONE
For quickly toughening up POKéMON,
items are the best.
PROTEIN boosts ATTACK, and CALCIUM
raises SP. ATK.
I want my POKéMON to have more
endurance.
I'm trying to decide whether to raise
DEFENSE with IRON, or SP. DEF with ZINC.
I gave a CARBOS to my POKéMON and its
SPEED went up.
ESSENTIALS FOR UNBEATABLE TRAINERS
3F: BATTLE COLLECTION
Hmm...
An attacking move...
Or a defensive move...
It's no easy matter to decide which TM
moves should be taught to POKéMON...
There are so many different kinds of
TM moves.
A catalog I read said there are fifty
different kinds.
I'd like to get all the different TMs,
but a POKéMON learns only four moves.
A SHORTCUT TO POKéMON LEAGUE
4F: TM CORNER
This place is full of cute DOLLS.
I should buy some for me, instead of
just for my children.
I'm not big enough to raise POKéMON,
so I'm getting a cute DOLL instead.
They sell many cute MATS here.
I wonder which one I should get?
Maybe I'll buy them all...
ADORABLE FRIENDS
5F: POKé DOLL FLOOR
Don't they have set dates for their
clear-out sales?
I watch TV, but they never show any
commercials.
Yes! I've been waiting a long time for
this clear-out sale.
They have items that you can only get
here. I'm going to load up, that I am!
Ohh... I'm bone-dry thirsty!
It's a VENDING MACHINE.
Which drink would you like?
Clang!
A can of @
 dropped down.
Clang!
Score! An extra can of @
dropped down!
Not enough money...
Decided against buying a drink.
Yo, how's it going, CHAMPION-bound
LANDON?
The GYM LEADERS here use PSYCHIC-type
POKéMON.
If you go up against them with
FIGHTING- or POISON-type POKéMON,=they'll inflict horrible damage!
Plus, they'll come at you with
outstanding combination attacks.
If you want to win, you'll need to show
them how tight you are with your=POKéMON. Go for it!
Wow, you're astounding!
You're one great TRAINER!
Battles hinge on the strength of your
spirit! The weak-spirited will never win!
I lost! I must temper my spirit again!
The indecisive lose.
That's my warning to you.
Let me see your talent!
You possess spectacular talent!
If there are prodigies in the world,
then our GYM LEADERS are them!
However, you may be even more talented
than them...
Fufufufu... Watch me levitate a POKé
BALL telekinetically!
Wrooooooooaaaar!
... ... ... ... ... ... ...
Sometimes, I'm out of sync...
My POKéMON battling skills are out
of sync, too!
A POKé BALL was too heavy to lift
psychically. But this dust bunny...
Whoooooooooooooooh!
... ... ... ... ... ...
No, I'm not cheating!
I didn't blow on it! Honestly!
When you lose to me, don't be too hard
on yourself.
It's not that you're weak - I'm just
too strong!
You're just too strong!
I'm not going to get down on myself for
losing. I just need to train harder.
Positive thinking - that's my strong
point!
I see it...
I see your future...
If you can beat me, I will tell you
your future!
I surrender!
You will wage a terrifically intense
battle with our GYM LEADERS...
The result...
You won't hear it from me!
The roads you have traveled...
What you have experienced...
Come at me with everything you've
learned!
You've traveled a path of greatness!
A bright future awaits those who have
worked diligently.
For those who lazed idly, there is
only despair at the end.
What goes around comes around...
TATE: Hehehe... Were you surprised?
LIZA: Fufufu... Were you surprised?
TATE: That there are two GYM LEADERS?
LIZA: That there are two GYM LEADERS?
TATE: We're twins!
LIZA: We're twins!
TATE: We don't need to talk because...
LIZA: We can each determine what...
TATE: The other is thinking...
LIZA: All in our minds!
TATE: This combination of ours...
LIZA: Can you beat it?
TATE: What?! Our combination...
LIZA: Was shattered!
TATE: It can't be helped. You've won...
LIZA: So, in recognition, take this.
LANDON received the MIND BADGE
from LIZA and TATE.
TATE: The MIND BADGE enhances the
SP. ATK and SP. DEF of POKéMON.
LIZA: It also lets you use the HM move
DIVE outside of battle.
TATE: You should also take this, too.
TATE: That TM04 contains...
LIZA: CALM MIND!
TATE: It raises SP. ATK and...
LIZA: It raises SP. DEF!
TATE: It's a move that's perfect...
LIZA: For PSYCHIC POKéMON!
TATE: Looks like the bond between you
and your POKéMON is far stronger than=the bond that we share as twins.
LIZA: You will become even stronger!
We've battled you, so we know.
TATE: Hehehe... Were you surprised?
LIZA: That there are two GYM LEADERS?
TATE: Oops, you have only one...
LIZA: POKéMON that can battle.
TATE: We can't battle that way!
LIZA: If you want to challenge us,
bring some more POKéMON.

Hmm!

No, I'm positive of it! It definitely

It doesn't appear to like or dislike
any
My husband can tell what kind of
S a POKéMON likes at a glance.
My little sister exchanges MAIL with
her boyfriend in FORTREE.
I don't envy her one bit at all.
Even though I can't see my friend in
FORTREE, my POKéMON carries MAIL back=and forth for us.
I'm not lonesome, even though we're
apart.
WINGULL: Pihyoh!
The GYM LEADERS in this town are a
formidable duo.
Their combination attacks are, like,
excellent and wow!
Depending on the special abilities of
POKéMON, some moves might change=or not work at all.
If I win a whole lot of link battles
and show everyone how good I am,=I might get a fan following!
REVIVE is fantastic!
Give it to a fainted POKéMON, and the
POKéMON will arise.
But be careful, REVIVE doesn't restore
the used-up PP of moves.
MAX REPEL keeps all weak POKéMON away.
Out of all the REPEL sprays, it lasts
the longest.
The NET and DIVE BALLS are rare POKé
BALLS that are only made in MOSSDEEP.
A NET BALL is effective against
BUG-type and WATER-type POKéMON.
A DIVE BALL works best on POKéMON at
the bottom of the sea.
Hey there, TRAINER!
A SUPER ROD really is super!
Say all you want, but this baby can
catch POKéMON off the seafloor!
What do you think?
You want it, don't you?
You bet, you bet!
After all, a SUPER ROD is really super!
If there's any water, try dropping in
your ROD and see what bites!
Hunh?
Don't you like to fish?
Go after the seafloor POKéMON with
your SUPER ROD.
STEVEN: LANDON
Yes, this is my place. It's a little
embarrassing how empty it is here.
Oh, here, you should take this HM.
It contains DIVE.
I've already taught my POKéMON.
STEVEN: While you're using SURF, you
should notice dark patches of water.
Use DIVE if you come to deep water
like it. You'll drop to the seafloor.
When you want to come back up, use
DIVE again.
In some places, it won't be possible
for you to surface, though.
STEVEN: Apparently, there's an
underwater cavern between=MOSSDEEP and SOOTOPOLIS.
You know, the one that CAPT. STERN
found in his submarine.
An underwater cavern...
There might be some rare stones down
there... I should go for a DIVE...
LANDON checked the POKé BALL.
It contained the POKéMON
BELDUM.
Take the POKé BALL?
LANDON obtained a BELDUM.
There is no space for another POKéMON.
LANDON left the POKé BALL where
it was.
It's a letter.
... ... ... ... ... ...
To LANDON
...
I've decided to do a little soul-
searching and train on the road.
I don't plan to return home for some
time.
I have a favor to ask of you.
I want you to take the POKé BALL on
the desk.
Inside it is a BELDUM, my favorite
POKéMON.
I'm counting on you.
May our paths cross some day.

My little brother says he likes to

You should make a SECRET BASE

DELCATTY: Miyaan?
The rocket's launch is imminent!
The rocket launched safely!
That's successful launch no. @
A rocket launch demands perfection.
Not even a 1
 margin of error is allowed.
Even if it's 99
 okay, the whole thing
is useless if 1
 happens to be no good.
Despite that, we never stop trying.
Why? It's a dream that never ends.
I was taking a stroll down the beach
when I found this.
It's not anything I need, so you can
have it.
The HOENN region has been famous for
its meteor showers for a long time.
Some people claim that POKéMON came
from space. Could it be true?
A giant chunk of metal bursts through
the skies and flies into space...
It boggles my mind!
MOSSDEEP has mainly sunny weather,
and its winds are stable.
It's an ideal location for launching
rockets.
If only I was a little younger, I would
have liked being an astronaut...
No... It's not too late!
I can and will try!
I wish ordinary people could go into
space one day...
When I was young, I traveled the world
as a POKéMON TRAINER.
Now that I've become an old buzzard,
my only amusement is watching young=TRAINERS battle.
The door appears to be locked.
A TRAINER named @
 is
visiting my home.
Would you like to challenge
You won't battle? I'm disappointed
that I can't see you battle...
Oh, good, good!
But my house isn't all that sturdy.
Could I ask you to keep it down to
a 3-on-3 match?
Before you two battle, you should
save your progress.
I hope to see a good match!
The match ended up a draw.
So, it became a standoff.
It was a brilliant match in which
neither side conceded a step!
That was superlative!
Why, it was like seeing myself in my
youth again!
Ah, too bad for you!
But it was a good match.
I hope you can win next time.
Yo! How's it going, CHAMPION-
bound LANDON?
SOOTOPOLIS's GYM LEADER WALLACE is
a master of WATER-type POKéMON.
And, to get to WALLACE, an icy floor
will hamper your progress...
Listen, I'm sorry, but that's all the
advice that I have for you.
The rest of the way, you have to
go for it yourself!
Yow! You've beaten even WALLACE, who
was supposedly the best in all HOENN!
Okay! Check out your TRAINER's CARD.
If you've gotten all the BADGES, you're
set for the POKéMON LEAGUE challenge!
I'll show you the sublime techniques
I learned from our LEADER WALLACE!
Please forgive me, WALLACE...
Watch what happens if you crack all
the floor tiles.
You came all the way here, but you won't
get to see WALLACE.
Not if you lose to me, you won't!
You're strong!
I was fooled by your cute looks!
You might be good enough to avoid
being wiped out in one hit by WALLACE.
The sight of WALLACE conducting a
battle...
The very beauty of it compelled me to
become a TRAINER.
You battled with more beauty than
I could muster...
The grace you bring to battle is
fabulous.
Oh... I'm so fortunate to have found
POKéMON.
I should teach you how harsh battles
can be.
Oh.
You're strong.
I'll tell you something good.
If you want to reach WALLACE, you
need to walk on each floor tile once.
The POKéMON GYM of the highest level
in the HOENN region...
That's the SOOTOPOLIS GYM.
What a high level you are!
Rather than being satisfied by being
in a strong GYM, I imagine training in=other places will make you stronger.=But above all, it looks more fun.
I train my POKéMON together with
WALLACE.
Don't think I'm a pushover.
I was bowled right over...
I think you have potential.
Why don't you stay and train with us?
A graceful glide across the ice while
crossing no lines...
A TRAINER putting on that performance
would be elegantly beautiful!
Well, excuse me?!
This is really obvious, but how strong
you are as a TRAINER has nothing to do=with how young or old you are.
When I'm with my POKéMON, the time
flies by before you can say, "Oops!"2
Oops!
I wish I can forget about lost causes
before I can manage an "Oops!"2
Allow me to formally introduce
myself.
I am WALLACE.
The GYM LEADER of SOOTOPOLIS.
There's something about you...
A difference in your demeanor.
I think I sense that in you.
What happened inside the CAVE OF
ORIGIN, and what you did, I will likely=learn through our upcoming battle.
Now, show me. Show me the power you
wield with your POKéMON.
And I, in turn, shall present you with
a performance of illusions in water=by me and my POKéMON!
Bravo.
I realize now your authenticity and
magnificence as a POKéMON TRAINER.
I find much joy in having met you and
your POKéMON.
You have proven yourself worthy of
the RAIN BADGE. Accept it.
LANDON received the RAIN BADGE
from WALLACE.
Having that BADGE assures you the
full obedience of all your POKéMON to=every command you make.
The BADGE also allows the use of the
HM move WATERFALL to scale walls=of cascading water.
And, so that you never forget the
battle we shared, take this...
The TM I handed you contains
WATER PULSE.
In use, it will occasionally confuse
the target with ultrasonic waves.
TRAINERS who have gathered all the
GYM BADGES of HOENN should make way=for the ultimate destination.
The POKéMON LEAGUE.
Travel to the easternmost reaches
of HOENN, to the island EVER GRANDE.=The POKéMON LEAGUE is there.
There remains but one BADGE to
obtain in HOENN.
If you wish to challenge the POKéMON
LEAGUE, you must obtain the last=BADGE from the GYM in FORTREE.

WALLACE'S CERTIFIED TRAINERS:
LANDON
WALLACE, this town's GYM LEADER, is a
powerful TRAINER.
He's rumored to be the best in the
whole HOENN region.
But the ELITE FOUR...
They're said to be even stronger than
WALLACE. How strong could they be?
Everyone in town has taken refuge
and won't come out of their homes.
This weather..
Could it be the prelude to something?
Whenever, wherever, and whatever
happens, I will always be friends with=POKéMON.
Because it's fun to be with POKéMON!
I don't know why...
But... I'm really scared...
PP UP is great!
It raises the POWER POINTS, the PP,
of a POKéMON move.
What... What is happening?
Do you know FULL RESTORE?
Full restoration of HP!
Eradication of all status problems!
It's truly an item of your dreams!
This weather...
Did something awaken?
For thirty years I've remained in
SOOTOPOLIS honing my skills.
I developed a shattering TM.
I bequeath it to you!
TM31 contains BRICK BREAK! It's a move
so horrible that I can't describe it.
KECLEON: Puu puhyaah.
MT. PYRE...
At its peak are two orbs placed side
by side. Did you know?
Yes, two orbs side by side...
The sight of them together...
It is somehow soothing...
Is that so?
Perhaps you ought to visit and see...
You're a POKéMON TRAINER, aren't you?
SOOTOPOLIS's GYM LEADER WALLACE has
many fans.=Do you have any?
Oh, then you must be pretty strong.
Oh, dear...
That's a little lonesome.
Try working a little harder to get a
fan following.
Dedicated fans come over from even
KANTO and JOHTO.
It was really wild when I went to the
TRAINER FAN CLUB in LILYCOVE.
Listen up, and I'll tell you something
good.
There's supposed to be an ancient
ruin in the sea around here.
There could be treasures just waiting
to be discovered down there.
Ancient treasures...
It would be nice if they existed, but
even if they didn't, it would be so=beautiful to take an underwater=stroll with my POKéMON.
AZUMARILL: Marurii.
There appears to be some connection
between SOOTOPOLIS and MT. PYRE.
My friends and I did some research on
it at the lab where I used to work.
My big brother used to study the sea.
Hello! You're our first guest in a
good while.
You've brightened up my day, so I'll
give you a big WAILMER DOLL.
Take good care of it!
Oh, you want it, but not right now?
Okay, then I'll hold it for you.
Are you sure?
You don't want this DOLL?
I love plush DOLLS!
An underwater volcano erupted and
forced itself up from the depths.
Its crater emerged from the sea and
became filled with rainwater.
That's how SOOTOPOLIS CITY came into
being.
The cave that links SOOTOPOLIS and
the outside world...
It seems as if the cave was made to
keep something from getting out.
Or am I just imagining things?
Do you know the POKéMON SHROOMISH?
It's hardly ever seen in SOOTOPOLIS.
Anyway, I love big SHROOMISH.
The bigger the better.
But my younger brother, he says that
BARBOACH is bigger.
That's silly. SHROOMISH has to be
bigger than that!
Huh? Do you have a SHROOMISH with you?
P-p-please, show me!
 inches!
Oh, my gosh, this is a big one!
It might even beat the big BARBOACH
my younger brother saw!
Thanks for showing me.
This is my thanks!
LANDON received a POTION.
Hunh?
Your BAG is crammed full.
 inches, is it?
Hmm... I've seen a bigger SHROOMISH
than this one.
Oh, now this is quite something...
But it's not a SHROOMISH!
You don't have a big SHROOMISH?
That's too bad...
If you get a big SHROOMISH, please
come show me.
The biggest SHROOMISH in history!
's @
-inch giant!
A SHROOMISH bigger than a BARBOACH
always wanted!
Do you know the POKéMON BARBOACH?
It's rarely seen in SOOTOPOLIS.
I love, I mean love, big BARBOACH!
My big brother says that SHROOMISH is
bigger.
But that's wrong! Everyone knows that
BARBOACH is a lot bigger.
Hunh? Do you have a BARBOACH?
P-p-please show me!
 inches!
Wow, that is big!
It might be even bigger than the huge
SHROOMISH my big brother saw.
Thanks for showing me!
This is my thanks!
Whoops, looks like your BAG is full.
 inches?
Hmm... I've seen a bigger BARBOACH
than this one here.
Well, isn't this something!
But it's no BARBOACH!
Don't you have a big BARBOACH?
How disappointing...
If you get a big BARBOACH, please
come show me!
The biggest BARBOACH in history!
's @
-inch colossus!
A BARBOACH bigger than a SHROOMISH
always wanted!
Welcome, challenger!
I'm SIDNEY of the ELITE FOUR.
I like that look you're giving me.
I guess you'll give me a good match.=That's good! Looking real good!
All right! You and me, let's enjoy a
battle that can only be staged here=in the POKéMON LEAGUE!
Well, how do you like that? I lost!
Eh, it was fun, so it doesn't matter.
Well, listen to what this loser has
to say.
You've got what it takes to go far.
Now, go on to the next room and enjoy=your next battle!
Ahahaha!
I'm PHOEBE of the ELITE FOUR.
I did my training on MT. PYRE.
While I trained, I gained the ability
to commune with GHOST-type POKéMON.
Yes, the bond I developed with POKéMON
is extremely tight.
So, come on, just try and see if you can
even inflict damage on my POKéMON!
Oh, darn.
I've gone and lost.
There's a definite bond between you
and your POKéMON, too.
I didn't recognize it, so it's only
natural that I lost.
Yup, I'd like to see how far your bond
will carry you.
Go ahead, move on to the next room.
Welcome, my name is GLACIA of the
ELITE FOUR.
I've traveled from afar to HOENN so
that I may hone my ice skills.
But all I have seen are challenges by
weak TRAINERS and their POKéMON.
What about you?
It would please me to no end if I could
go all out against you!
You and your POKéMON...
How hot your spirits burn!
The all-consuming heat overwhelms.
It's no surprise that my icy skills
failed to harm you.
Advance to the next room.
And there, confirm the truly fearsome
side of the POKéMON LEAGUE.
I am the last of the POKéMON LEAGUE
ELITE FOUR, DRAKE the DRAGON master!
In their natural state, POKéMON are
wild living things. They are free.
At times, they hinder us.
At times, they help us.
For us to battle with POKéMON as
partners, do you know what it takes?
Do you know what is needed?
If you don't, then you will never
prevail over me!
Superb, it should be said.
You deserve every credit for coming
this far as a TRAINER of POKéMON.
You do seem to know what is needed.
Yes, what a TRAINER needs is a
virtuous heart.
POKéMON touch the good hearts of
TRAINERS and learn good from wrong.
They touch the good hearts of
TRAINERS and grow strong.
Go! Go onwards!
The CHAMPION is waiting!
STEVEN: Welcome, LANDON
I was looking forward to seeing you
here one day.
You... What did you see on your
journey with POKéMON?
What did you feel, meeting so many
other TRAINERS like you?
What has awoken in you?
I want you to hit me with it all!
Now, bring it!
I, the CHAMPION, fall in defeat...
Kudos to you, LANDON
You are a truly noble POKéMON
TRAINER!
STEVEN: Congratulations!
The feelings you have for your
POKéMON...
And the POKéMON that responded to
those feelings with all their might...
They came together as one, and created
an even greater power.
And thus, you were able to grasp
victory today!
You are rightfully the HOENN region's
new...
MAY: LANDON
Here's some advice before you challenge
the CHAMPION...
MAY: Huh? What, what, what?
LANDON
...
Could it be that...=It's already over?
BRENDAN: LANDON!
How would you like some advice before
you challenge the CHAMPION?...
BRENDAN: LANDON...
Are you trying to tell me...
You've beaten the CHAMPION?
PROF. BIRCH: See?
What did I tell you, @
Didn't I tell you that you don't need
to worry about LANDON
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
LANDON
, you've finally done it.
When I heard that you defeated your
own father at the PETALBURG GYM,=I thought perhaps you had a chance...
But to think you've actually become
the CHAMPION!
Ah, yes!
What became of your POKéDEX?
Here, let me see.
PROF. BIRCH: Anyways,
congratulations!
Now, go proudly into the final room!
STEVEN: LANDON
...
No, the new CHAMPION!
Come with me.
STEVEN: I'm sorry, but...
From here on, only those TRAINERS who
have become CHAMPIONS may enter.
You'll have to wait outside with the
PROFESSOR.
MAY: Groan...
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
I'm just joking! That's okay!
That's the rule!
LANDON
Honestly, congratulations!
BRENDAN: ... ... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
It can't be helped if that's the rule.
LANDON, way to go!
Congratulations!
Beyond this point, only those TRAINERS
who have collected all the GYM BADGES=are permitted to enter.
TRAINER, let us confirm that you have
all the GYM BADGES.
You haven't obtained all the BADGES.
If you're bound for the POKéMON
LEAGUE, you must return with them.
TRAINER! Believe in yourself and your
POKéMON, and go forth!
STEVEN: This room...
This is where we keep records of
POKéMON that prevailed through=harsh battles.
It is here that the LEAGUE CHAMPIONS
are honored.
STEVEN: Come on, let's record your
name as a TRAINER who triumphed over=the POKéMON LEAGUE, and the names of=the partners who battled with you.
The POKéMON LEAGUE is only a short
distance after the VICTORY ROAD.
If you've come this far, what choice
do you have but to keep going?
The long and harrowing VICTORY ROAD...
It's like reliving the path one has
traveled in life...
Believe in your POKéMON and give it
your very best!
MR. BRINEY: Hold on, lass!
Wait up, PEEKO!
Hm? You're LANDON
You saved my darling PEEKO!=We owe so much to you!
What's that?
You want to sail with me?
Hmhm...
You have a LETTER bound for DEWFORD
and a package for SLATEPORT, then?
Quite the busy life you must lead!
But, certainly, what you're asking is
no problem at all.
You've come to the right man!
We'll set sail for DEWFORD.
MR. BRINEY: DEWFORD, here we come!
Anchors aweigh!
PEEKO, we're setting sail, my darling!
MR. BRINEY: Is that so?
Your deliveries can wait?
You just go on and tell me whenever
you want to set sail!
MR. BRINEY: Ahoy!
I know exactly what you want to say!
You're to deliver a LETTER to DEWFORD
and a package to SLATEPORT.
What you need me to do is no problem
at all - I'm the man for the job!
First, we'll set sail for DEWFORD.
MR. BRINEY: Ahoy!
I know exactly what you want to say!
You're to deliver a package to
CAPT. STERN in SLATEPORT.
What you need me to do is no problem
at all - I'm the man for the job!
First, we'll set sail for DEWFORD.
MR. BRINEY: Ahoy!
For you, I'll go out to sea anytime!
Now, my friend, where are we bound?
MR. BRINEY: Is that so?
Well, PEEKO owes her life to you.
You just go on and tell me whenever
you want to set sail!
MR. BRINEY: Ahoy!
We've made land in PETALBURG!
You just go on and tell me whenever
you want to set sail!
PEEKO: Pii pihyoroo!
You're the first TRAINER I've seen who
deploys POKéMON so masterfully.
But, I should tell you - my son is
stronger than you.
He even took the POKéMON LEAGUE
challenge, I'll have you know.
We use this MACHO BRACE to more
effectively strengthen our POKéMON=in training.
Since you've beaten our entire family,
I don't know if you need it, but we=would like you to have our MACHO BRACE.
When it comes to POKéMON battles,
we tend to be pretty passionate.
Mommy is stronger than Daddy.
I'm stronger than Mommy.
And Grandma's stronger than me!
But my big brother is even stronger
than Grandma.
There's no question that you're strong.
But if you were to battle my grandson,
you'd end up crying in frustration.
He's much stronger than any TRAINER
our family knows.
He must be challenging the POKéMON
LEAGUE CHAMPION by now.
Knowing my grandson, he could be the
CHAMPION already!
My grandson must be challenging the
POKéMON LEAGUE CHAMPION by now.
Knowing my grandson, he could be the
CHAMPION already!
Oh, dear, dear.
Aren't your POKéMON exhausted?
If you'd like, rest up here.
That's a fine idea! You should do that.
That's right.
Take your time and rest up!
Oh, dear, dear.
Are your POKéMON still tired?
You should take another rest here.
That's a fine idea. You should do that.
Is that so?
You don't need to be shy about it.
The CABLE CAR is ready to go up.
Would you like to be on it?
Please step this way.
Please ride with us another time.
The CABLE CAR is ready to go down.
Would you like to be on it?
Please step this way.
Please ride with us another time.
My big brother's the FOSSIL MANIAC...
He's a nice guy who loves fossils...
He loves digging holes, too...
He dug this hole by himself...
You can have this, so you can DIG
holes just like my big brother...
If you make a POKéMON DIG inside a
cave, you're returned to the entrance...
Rocks in peculiar shapes fill the
display case

Do you want a fossil?
But the fossils around these parts all
belong to me... None for you...
If you can't go without a fossil, go to
the desert on ROUTE 111...
From what I've heard, fossils that were
buried in the sand sometimes rise to=the surface from sandstorms...
You found a FOSSIL, didn't you?
That's so nice... It's so dreamy...
What are you going to do with that
FOSSIL?
From what I've heard, DEVON is doing
research on reviving POKéMON from=FOSSILS...
I love my FOSSILS, so I would never
do anything like that...
FOSSILS are so... Wonderful...
It's so dreamy...
LANETTE: Oh! LANDON
I'm sorry everything is so cluttered...
When I get engrossed in research,=things end up this way...
This is embarrassing... Please keep
this a secret in exchange for this.
May I offer advice about my POKéMON
Storage System?
You should organize your BOXES so you
can tell which POKéMON are in them.
It's LANETTE's research notes.
There's information about BOXES.
Design BOXES to hold 30 POKéMON each.
Each TRAINER should be able to store
420 POKéMON on the PC system.
Keep reading?
A marking system should be added to
make POKéMON easier to organize.
The name and wallpaper design of each
BOX will be made changeable to please=the stored POKéMON.
Keep reading?
When storing a POKéMON, it should be
sent to the BOX inspected last.
If that BOX is full, the received
POKéMON is stored in the next BOX.
In other words, when a BOX is examined,
it is automatically selected as the BOX=to which POKéMON are sent.
LANDON closed the notebook.
There's an e-mail from someone on
the PC.
"... ... ... ... ... ... ...
"Your Storage System offers more
convenience than mine.
"It has a lot of user-friendly features
that make it fun and useful, too.
"It makes me proud that I played
a part in its development.
"Here's hoping that you'll continue
research in Storage Systems.

That RUSTURF TUNNEL there...
At first, we had a huge work crew boring
through rock with the latest machinery.=But, we had to stop.
It turns out that we would have had
a negative effect on wild POKéMON in=the area.
So, we've got nothing to do but loll
around here doing nothing.
There's a man digging his way to
VERDANTURF all by his lonesome.=He's desperate to get through.
He says that if he digs little by little
without using machines, he won't=disturb POKéMON, and he'll avoid harming=the natural environment.
To get to VERDANTURF without using
this TUNNEL, you'd have to cross the=sea to DEWFORD, sail on to SLATEPORT,=then travel through MAUVILLE.
Did you hear? The TUNNEL to VERDANTURF
has gone through!
Sometimes, if you hope strongly enough,
dreams do come true.
Hehehe!
With this METEORITE, MT. CHIMNEY
will...
Heh?
I don't know who you are, but if you get
in the way of TEAM @
, don't=expect any mercy!
Hold it right there, TEAM @
We, TEAM @
, won't allow you to
get away with your misdeeds!
Hehehe!
Even TEAM @
 joins us!
But it's too much trouble to deal with
you all...
Heh, it doesn't matter!
We've got the METEORITE, so off to
MT. CHIMNEY we go!
Hehehe! Be seeing you, you TEAM
 dingbats!
And you are?
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
Fine, so you are LANDON
I am MAXIE. As the head of TEAM MAGMA,
I have dedicated myself to thwarting=the dangerous plans of TEAM AQUA.
Why? Because TEAM AQUA is a grave
threat to us all.
They have committed many destructive
acts in their bid to enlarge the sea.
We, TEAM MAGMA, love dry land above
all! TEAM AQUA is our sworn enemy!
Who might you be?
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
Ah, so you are LANDON
I am ARCHIE. As the head of TEAM AQUA,
I have dedicated myself to thwarting=the dangerous plans of TEAM MAGMA.
Why? Because TEAM MAGMA is a grave
threat to us all.
They have committed many destructive
acts in their bid to expand the land.
We, TEAM AQUA, love the sea above
all! TEAM MAGMA is our sworn enemy!
, we should give chase to
TEAM @
...
: Yes, yes, we must!
We've got to hurry.
There's no telling what TEAM @
will do at MT. CHIMNEY!
: LANDON
, you should keep
an eye out for TEAM @
, too.
Farewell!
I... I'm COZMO...
I'm a PROFESSOR...
I usually study METEORITES in
FALLARBOR TOWN...
Then some people from TEAM @
made me guide them to METEOR FALLS...
They promised me that they would
excavate METEORITES for me...
But, I...
TEAM @
 tricked me...
Oh... That METEORITE...
It will never be mine now...
But that TEAM @
...
What are they going to do with that
METEORITE at MT. CHIMNEY?
PROF. COZMO: That TEAM @
...
What are they going to do with that
METEORITE at MT. CHIMNEY?
This is where we DRAGON users do our
training.
The CHAMPION even visits.
Now do you see how special it is here?
Urgh!
I didn't expect you to be so strong!
The road ahead remains long and harsh.
When will my POKéMON and I become the
best?
Since we met, we have trained hard
with our sights on number one.
Help us see how much stronger we've
become!
Urgh!
I didn't expect you to be so strong!
You've obviously kept up your
POKéMON training.
So long as you remain strong, I, too,
can become stronger!
JOHN: We've always battled POKéMON
together as a twosome.=We've confidence in ourselves.
JOHN: Oh, my.
We've lost, dear wife.
JOHN: We've been married for
fifty years.
Come to think of it, I've yet to beat
my dear wife in a battle.
JOHN: Well, well, what a young TRAINER!
Will you battle with us? If so, you'll
have to return with more POKéMON.
JAY: We've been married for
fifty years.
The bond we share as a couple could
never be broken.
JAY: Oh, dear.
We've lost, my dear husband.
JAY: Fifty years of marriage...
If we ever argued, we always settled
it with a POKéMON battle...
JAY: Well, well, aren't you a young
TRAINER?
If you'd care to battle with us, you'll
have to come back with more POKéMON.
JOHN: We've always battled POKéMON
together as a twosome.=We've confidence in ourselves.
JOHN: Oh, my.
We've lost, dear wife.
JOHN: Married for fifty years...
On reflection, the dear wife and I,
we battled day in and day out...
JOHN: Well, well, what a young
TRAINER!
Will you battle with us? If so, you'll
have to return with more POKéMON.
JAY: We've been married for
fifty years.
We've supported each other all that
time. We've made ourselves strong.
JAY: Oh, dear.
We've lost, my dear husband.
JAY: Fifty years of marriage...
Many things have happened.
I hope that we will continue to make
happy memories together.
JAY: Well, well, aren't you a young
TRAINER?
If you'd care to battle with us, you'll
have to come back with more POKéMON.
What, are you coming?
Come and get some, then!
PEEKO: Pii pihyoh!
Grah, keelhaul it all!
That hostage POKéMON turned out to
be worthless!
And to think I made a getaway...
In this tunnel to nowhere!
Hey! You!
So you want to battle me?
Urrrggh! My career in crime comes to
a dead end!
This is plain not right...
The BOSS told me this would be a
slick-and-easy job to pull.
All I had to do was steal some package
from DEVON.
Tch!
You want it back that badly, take it!
PEEKO! Am I glad to see you're safe!
PEEKO owes her life to you!
They call me MR. BRINEY.
And, you are?
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
Ah, so you are LANDON
I sincerely thank you!
Now, if there's anything that troubles
you, don't hesitate to tell me!
You can usually find me in my cottage
by the sea near PETALBURG WOODS.
Come, PEEKO, we should make our way
home.
PEEKO: Pihyoh!
... ...
Why can't they keep digging?
Is the bedrock too hard?
My beloved awaits me in VERDANTURF
TOWN just beyond here...
If RUSTBORO and VERDANTURF were
joined by this tunnel, I could visit=her every day...
But this...
What am I to do?
To get from RUSTBORO to VERDANTURF,
you need to go to DEWFORD, then pass=through SLATEPORT and MAUVILLE...
Wow! You shattered that boulder
blocking the way.
To show you how much I appreciate it,
I'd like you to have this HM.
That HM contains STRENGTH.
If a muscular POKéMON were to learn
that, it would be able to move even=large boulders.
WANDA!
Now I can see you anytime!
WANDA: That's...wonderful.
Please, take some rest at my home.
On the other side of this rock...
My boyfriend is there.
He... He's not just digging the tunnel
to come see me.
He works his hands raw and rough
for the benefit of everyone.
What do you call a wild man up in the
mountains? A mountain man, right?
So why don't they call a POKéMON in the
mountains a mountain POKéMON?
My POKéMON...
Ran out of power...
They halted development here to
protect POKéMON, right?=There's a feel-good story!
Hey, you.
It gets awfully dark ahead.=It'll be tough trying to explore.
That guy who came by earlier...
STEVEN, I think it was.
He knew how to use FLASH, so he ought
to be all right, but...
Well, for us HIKERS, helping out those
that we meet is our motto.
Here you go, I'll pass this on to you.
Teach that hidden move FLASH to a
POKéMON and use it.
It lights up even the inky darkness
of caves.
But, to use it, you need the GYM BADGE
from DEWFORD's POKéMON GYM.
That device you have there...
It's a POKéNAV.
When TRAINERS that have POKéNAVS
battle, it keeps a record of how=things went, I think.
Oh, pardon me.
My name is STEVEN.
I'm interested in rare stones, so
I travel here and there.
Oh?
A LETTER for me?
STEVEN: Okay, thank you.
You went through all this trouble to
deliver that. I need to thank you.
Let me see...
I'll give you this TM.
It contains my favorite move,
STEEL WING.
STEVEN: Your POKéMON appear quite
capable.
If you keep training, you could even
become the CHAMPION of the POKéMON=LEAGUE one day. That's what I think.
Now, I've got to hurry along.
Oh, your BAG is full...
That's too bad, then.
Hmmm...
Not a one to be found...
Hello, have you seen any POKéMON
called SHROOMISH around here?
I really love that POKéMON.
I was going to ambush you, but you
had to dawdle in PETALBURG WOODS=forever, didn't you?
I got sick of waiting, so here I am!
You! DEVON RESEARCHER!
Hand over those papers!
Aiyeeeh!
You're a POKéMON TRAINER, aren't you?
You've got to help me, please!
Hunh? What do you think you're doing?
What, you're going to protect him?
No one who crosses TEAM @
gets any mercy, not even a kid!
Come on and battle me!
You're kidding me! You're tough!
Grrr... You've got some nerve
meddling with TEAM @
!=Come on and battle me again!
I wish I could say that, but I'm out of
POKéMON...
And, hey, we of TEAM @
 are also
after something in RUSTBORO.
I'll let you go today!
Whew...
That was awfully close!
Thanks to you, he didn't rob me of
these important papers.
I know, I'll give you a GREAT BALL as
my thanks!
Didn't that TEAM @
 thug say
they were after something in=RUSTBORO, too?
Uh-oh! It's a crisis!
I can't be wasting time!
You're loaded with items.
I can't give you this GREAT BALL.
I caught a whole bunch of POKéMON!
Go, go, go!
My BUG POKéMON team!
I have all these POKéMON, but I
couldn't win...
I caught a bunch of POKéMON.
Now I'm out of POKé BALLS.
If you take BUG POKéMON to school,
you get to be instantly popular!
I can't be popular if I lose.
If you have a big BUG POKéMON, people
respect you for it.
My BUG POKéMON have grown.
I'll be popular again.
I can't be popular if I lose.
You get to be popular if you have
strong POKéMON, right?=So, I've been training hard.
Yo, there!
Your POKéMON doing okay?
If your POKéMON are weak and you want
to avoid battles, you should stay out=of tall grass.
Sometimes, there are things on the
ground even if you can't see them.
That's why I always check where I'm
walking.
Oh, neat!
That's the BADGE from RUSTBORO GYM!
You must be a TRAINER.
You should try using this item.
It's a MIRACLE SEED.
If a POKéMON holds that item, its=GRASS-type moves become stronger.
Besides MIRACLE SEED, I think there are
other convenient items for POKéMON=to hold.
TRAINER TIPS
Any POKéMON that appears even once
in a battle is awarded EXP Points.
To raise a weak POKéMON, put it at the
top of the team list.
As soon as a battle starts, switch it
out. It will earn EXP Points without=being exposed to any harm.
TRAINER TIPS
In addition to Hit Points (HP), POKéMON
have Power Points (PP) that are used to=make moves during battle.
If a POKéMON runs out of PP, it must be
taken to a POKéMON CENTER.
LAVA COOKIES are MT. CHIMNEY's local
specialty.
Try one. It's just $200.
Thank you, dear!
Oh, dear. You can't buy a thing if
you've not got the money.
Oh, fine then.
A METEORITE is fitted on a mysterious
machine...
The machine seems to be storing
energy in the METEORITE.
A METEORITE is fitted on a mysterious
machine...
Do you want to remove the METEORITE?
LANDON removed the METEORITE from
the mysterious machine.
LANDON left the METEORITE where
it was.
This mysterious machine...
It makes no response whatsoever.
-DOWN JAGGED PATH
LAVARIDGE TOWN AHEAD
I've been to the hot springs and
refreshed my tired bones.=Right now I'm feeling strong!
Oh, my goodness.
Now, aren't you something!
Well, well, I've lost. I can't call
myself an EXPERT now, can I?
If you can mesh your heart with those
of your POKéMON, why, you should be=able to achieve great things.
Oh, my goodness.
Now, aren't you something!
Perhaps your heart has become one
with the hearts of your POKéMON.
I've got the fire in me, baby.
I can't stand it! I have to battle!
Ooh, that was a scorching-hot match!
The heat of MT. CHIMNEY lights my
fire, baby!
I've finally made it to MT. CHIMNEY.
I want to make my POKéMON battle!
The way you battle...
It's like a MT. CHIMNEY eruption!
Like I said, I've finally made it to
MT. CHIMNEY. It would be a shame if=I only do a little sightseeing...
I want to get in some battles and buy
COOKIES as souvenirs.
Since I bathed in the hot springs,
I've been feeling great!=I'm sure I'm going to win!
Yowch!
I'm getting a chill out of the water.
I'll have to take another dip in the
hot springs. Want to join me?
Just joking!
MT. CHIMNEY's JAGGED PASS...
Now this is what I've always wanted
in a mountain.
This jagged bumpiness...
It rocks my soul!
Losing left me bitter!
Yes, I did lose at POKéMON...
But, when it comes to the love of
the mountains, I have you beat!
This place isn't your casual hike.
It's not suited for a picnic.
Ohhh, no!
The ground is too bumpy...
Did you know?
Some people cleverly ride their
bicycles up this horribly bumpy pass.
Picnics are fun wherever you go.
Just like POKéMON!
I only lost because the ground is
too bumpy!
I'll forget about losing and just
enjoy this bumpy hike.
JAGGED PASS is hard to walk on.
It's a good place for training.
It was all over while we were still
trying to find a good footing...
If I had an ACRO BIKE, I'd be able to
jump ledges.
I got used to this bumpiness.
I sing while I climb now.
It's still not easy to battle on this
bumpy ground...
I should get an ACRO BIKE from RYDEL
in MAUVILLE CITY...
All sorts of beings wander the slopes
of MT. PYRE...
There is no telling what may happen.
Take this. It's for your own good.
Have a POKéMON hold that
CLEANSE TAG.
It will help ward off wild POKéMON.
Did you come to pay your respect
to the spirits of departed POKéMON?
You must care for your POKéMON a lot.
This is the final resting place of my
ZIGZAGOON. I cherished it...
LUKE: We're here on a dare.
Heheh, if I show her how cool I am,
she'll fall for me. I know it!
I know! I'll cream you and show her
how cool I am!
LUKE: Whoopsie!
LUKE: Well, we lost but that's okay!
I'm right here by your side.=We'll make it through this dare!
LUKE: If you want to take me on, bring
some more POKéMON.
If you don't, I won't be able to show
off how cool I am to my girl!
DEZ: I came here on a dare with my
boyfriend.
It's really scary, but I'm with my
boyfriend. It's okay.
I know! I'll get my boyfriend to look
cool by beating you!
DEZ: Waaaah! I'm scared!
DEZ: We're lovey-dovey, so we don't
care if we lose!
DEZ: If you want to challenge us, you
should bring at least two POKéMON.
My boyfriend's strong.
Just one POKéMON won't do at all.
Memories of my darling SKITTY...
My eyes overflow thinking about it.
Ooch, ouch... There are holes in the
ground here and there.
I didn't notice and took a tumble from
the floor above.
Hey! Are you searching for POKéMON?
You came along after me! You're rude!
Ayieeeeh!
I'm sorry, forgive me, please!
People don't come here often, so
I thought there'd be rare POKéMON.
The rich atmosphere of the mountain
has elevated my psychic power!
A mere child like you...
You dream of winning?
I drown in self-pity...
My psychic powers have surely
grown several times, but...
Ahahahaha!
This is no place for children, least
of all you!
I lost that cleanly...
This means my training is still not
enough...
I've got to keep working toward the
summit...
Go, me!
Teacher...
Please watch over my progress!
Teacher...
Please forgive me!
Until I improve, my teacher, who rests
here, will never find true peace...
I love all things horrifying...
It's like a disease...
When I'm here...
I shiver with fear...
Losing, I dislike...
I want to see dreadful things...
I can't leave...
Stay...
Won't you stay with me?
When I'm here...
A curious power flows into me...
The power is ebbing away...
Perhaps the power is from the spirits
of POKéMON in fitful sleep here...
Behind you...
What is it...
Something faded away...
The POKéMON at rest here...
Sometimes, they play...
What? What? What do you want with
TEAM @
Our BOSS isn't here! He's gone off to
snatch something important!
... ...
Where did he go?
Wahaha! Do you really think I'd tell
you something that crucial?
What? What? What do you want with
TEAM @
Our BOSS isn't here!
He's gone off to jack a submarine!
... ...
Where did he go?
Wahaha! Do you really think I'd tell
you something that crucial?
What? What? What do you want with
TEAM @
Our BOSS isn't here! He's on his way to
MT. PYRE on ROUTE 122!
... ...
Why did he go?
Wahaha! Do you really think I'd tell
you something that crucial?
What? What? What do you want with
TEAM @
Our BOSS isn't here!
He's on his way to SLATEPORT CITY!
... ...
Why did he go?
Wahaha! Do you really think I'd tell
you something that crucial?
Ayiyiyi!
Suspicious character spotted!
Grrrrr...
I lost it!
I took the loss for the TEAM, but
I did my job...
If you want to know the secret about
our HIDEOUT, you have me to beat!
I can't win at all...
Our HIDEOUT's secret?
Well, let's just say...
There's a submarine at the far end!
But, by now...
Kekekeke...
Fuel supply loaded A-OK!
In-cruise snacks loaded A-OK!
Nothing left to do but KO a pesky
meddler!
I took a serious licking!
Humph!
This was supposed to happen!
My mission was to just hold you up!
Yawn... Keeping watch over the
HIDEOUT bores me. I'll take you on.
Yawn...
Oh, I lost...
If you scurry too much, other TEAM
 members might get you.
Hehehe...
Got here already, did you?
We underestimated you!
But this is it!
I'm a cut above the GRUNTS you've seen
so far.
I'm not stalling for time. I'm going
to pulverize you!
Hehehe...
So, I lost, too...
Hehehe!
While I was toying with you, our BOSS
got through his preparations!
Hehehe!
Our BOSS has already gone on his way to
some cave under the sea!
If you're going to give chase, you'd
better search the big, wide sea beyond=LILYCOVE.
But will you find it then?
Hehehe!
Wahahah, I grew weary of waiting!
You owe me a battle, too!
Tired of waiting...
Lost and dazed...
BOSS...
Is this good enough?
Warp panels, the HIDEOUT's pride
and joy!
You're clueless about where you are,
aren't you?
Fluster and tire out the enemy, then
lower the boom! That's our plan!
What's wrong with you?
You're not tired at all!
That reminds me... I can't remember
where I put the MASTER BALL.
If I fail to guard it, our BOSS will
chew me out...
"SUBMARINE EXPLORER 1"2 is painted
on the hull.
This is the submarine TEAM @
stole in SLATEPORT!
TEAM @
 must have gone
ashore here.
We don't need a kid around!
Go on home already!
I want to go home...
I want to get a promotion so I can
boss around the GRUNTS...
That submarine... It's tiny inside.
I'm sore all over!
Losing makes me sore!
That submarine we jacked, man, it's
brutal as a ride.=It's way too tight in there!
Ahahahaha!
How did you manage to get here without
a submarine?=What an impressive child!
But... It won't do to have you
meddling about here.
And, I do want payback for what
happened at the WEATHER INSTITUTE...
I'm going to give you a little taste
of pain! Resign yourself to it!
Ahahahaha!
Ouch!
Ahahahaha!
You're so darn strong.
It's terribly disappointing that you're
not a TEAM @
 member.
You could have enjoyed the fabulous
world our BOSS has promised to one=of our own...
Who are you?
Where did you come in from?
Lost it...
I can't find the way out!
I'm not afraid. Don't get me wrong!
WALLY: Hi! LANDON!
I bet you're surprised to see me here!
I made it all the way here, and it's
all thanks to you!
LANDON, losing to you that time
made me stronger!
But I'm not going to lose anymore!
I'm going to win! For the POKéMON who
gave me courage and strength!
Okay... Here I come!
Wow!
LANDON, you are strong, after all!
WALLY: I couldn't beat you today,
LANDON, but one of these days, I'll=catch up to you!
WALLY: Hi! LANDON!
I've gotten stronger since that last
time! I wanted to show you, LANDON!
Okay... Here I come!
Wow!
LANDON, you are strong, after all!
WALLY: I couldn't beat you this time,
too... But one of these days, LANDON,=I'm going to catch up to you...
And challenge the POKéMON LEAGUE!
I've made it this far a couple times,
but the last stretch is so long...
My dream ends here again...
You've made it this far. Keep the
momentum going and become the=CHAMPION! If anyone can, it's you!
I didn't come all this way to lose now.
That possibility doesn't exist!
Impossible...
I lost?
I lost here...
That means I lack the qualifications
to become the CHAMPION...
This seemingly infinite and harsh road
lives up to its name of VICTORY.
Your battle style is fantastic...
You seem to have the potential for
becoming the CHAMPION.
The thought that I'm getting closer to
the POKéMON LEAGUE...
I'm getting stage fright...
I couldn't do a thing...
The POKéMON LEAGUE became distant
again... What a letdown...
To win your way through the POKéMON
LEAGUE, you need the trust of your=POKéMON.
Your relationship is based on
solid trust.
By being together all the time, trust
grows between POKéMON and TRAINERS.
This isn't the goal. It's only a place
on the way to the POKéMON LEAGUE.
That's the way!
You'll do fine, for sure!
Your POKéMON are all eager to go!
I trained together with my whole family,
every one of us!=I'm not losing to anyone!
Better than my family?!
Is that possible?!
I was better than everyone in my
family. I've never lost before...
I've lost my confidence...
Maybe I'll go home...
I'd heard that there was a tough
little kid around. Do they mean you?
The little shrimp is tough!
The rumors I heard, that tough little
kid is from PETALBURG CITY.
You must be getting a little tired.
No signs of tiring at all!
VICTORY ROAD and the POKéMON LEAGUE
are long and grueling challenges.=Beware of fatigue!
You shouldn't get complacent just
because you have a lot of GYM BADGES.
There's always going to be someone
who's better than you!
You're better than me!
Gaze on your collected BADGES and
remember the TRAINERS you've faced.
The penetrating cold around these
parts is an impediment to training.
But with focus, one can overcome!
With this FOCUS BAND, buckle down and
withstand the cold!
Everything starts with focus!
The door is closed.
Use the BASEMENT KEY?
LANDON used the BASEMENT KEY.
The door opened!
The generator is radiating heat that
can be felt even at a distance.
It looks like it should be turned off
as soon as possible.
The generator quieted down.
LANDON stepped on the switch.
Click...
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
The generator appears to have
stopped...
What's so funny about having my inner
tube aboard the ship?
Whoa, you overwhelmed me!
It's not easy throwing POKé BALLS
while hanging on to an inner tube!
Isn't it fun here?
I get excited just being here!
Ships of this sort are rare, so I'm
taking a look around.
Hmhm...
There appear to be other cabins...
When we go out to sea, we SAILORS
always bring our POKéMON.=How about a quick battle?
Whoops, I'm sunk!
The ship's bottom has sunk into the
depths.
If a POKéMON knew how to go underwater,
we might make some progress...
Yay!
It's a ship!
The door is locked.
"STORAGE"2 is painted on the door.
LANDON inserted and turned the
STORAGE KEY.
The inserted KEY stuck fast, but the
door opened.
The door is open.
Urrrrppp...
I'm getting queasy just being aboard
this ship...
It's not even moving, but...
This is a perfect place to go exploring!
It's exciting here!
I bet there're amazing treasures on
board.
HAL: While searching for treasures,
we discovered a TRAINER!
HAL: We couldn't win even though
we worked together...
HAL: We can't find any treasures...
I wonder if someone got them already?
HAL: You don't even have two POKéMON.
You can't expect to beat us like that.
LOIS: Oh? We were looking for some
treasure, but we only found a TRAINER.
LOIS: Oh, wow, you're strong!
LOIS: I wonder where the treasures
are hidden?
I already know what I'm going to buy
when I find them!
LOIS: Don't you have two POKéMON?
We'll have to battle another time!
HAL: We've been searching for
treasures all this time.
Our POKéMON have grown stronger, too.
Let us show you, okay?
HAL: You're strong as usual!
HAL: We can't find any treasures,
we lose at POKéMON...
I want to go home... But if I say that,
she gets all angry with me...
HAL: You don't even have two POKéMON.
You can't expect to beat us like that.
LOIS: Oh, hi, we meet again!
Just like us, you haven't given up
searching for treasures!
How about we battle, and the loser has
to give up looking?
LOIS: Oh, we lost again...
LOIS: We'll raise our POKéMON more.
We're not going home until we find our
treasures!
LOIS: Don't you have two POKéMON?
We'll have to battle another time!
I'm investigating this ship on behalf
of CAPT. STERN.
He also asked me to find a SCANNER,
but I haven't had any success...
Oh! That's a SCANNER!
Listen, can I get you to deliver that
to CAPT. STERN?
I want to investigate this ship a
little more.
This ship is called S.S. CACTUS.
It seems to be from an earlier era.

It's bright and shiny!
But it's just trash...
There's a small indent in the wall.
There's a small indent in the wall.
Use the SECRET POWER?
Discovered a small cavern!
Want to make your SECRET BASE here?
The box is printed with a POKéMON logo.
It's a POKéMON brand moving and
delivery service.
This ferry is built to plow through
fast-running currents.
We hope you enjoy your voyage with us.
Feel free to explore the ship.
We hope you enjoy your voyage on
our ferry.
We have made land in SLATEPORT CITY.
Thank you for sailing with us.
We have made land in LILYCOVE CITY.
Thank you for sailing with us.
It'll be some time before we make land,
I reckon.
You can rest up in your cabin if you'd
like. Your cabin's No. 2.
The bed in there is soft and plushy.
I can attest to how comfy it is!
We've arrived!
Go visit other cabins.
TRAINERS bored of the boat trip will=be itching to battle.
Enjoy your cruise!
The horizon spreads beyond the
porthole.
MR. BRINEY: Welcome aboard, LANDON
They made me honorary captain of the
S.S. TIDAL!
You can call me CAPTAIN BRINEY now!
You know, I retired once before, but
when I saw this majestic ship...
Let me just say, it stirred my sleeping
soul as a sailor!
PEEKO: Pihyo pihyohyo...
Cabin 1
Cabin 2
Cabin 3
Cabin 4
Arrrgh! I'm fed up and dog-tired of
cleaning this huge place!
Let's have a quick battle!
Little bro, I lost!
We're the CLEANUP BROTHERS!
The old one dumps the detergent,
and the young one does the scrubbing!
This is the bottom of the ship's hull.
There's plenty of room.=It'll be alright for a POKéMON battle.
Big bro, I lost!
We're the CLEANUP BROTHERS!
The old one dumps the detergent,
and the young one does the scrubbing!
It's a bed.
Let's take a rest.
Go back and forth between LILYCOVE
and SLATEPORT, that's what I do.
It's my hobby - going from port to port
to take in POKéMON CONTESTS.
That was an enjoyable match!
I get so excited imagining what kinds
of POKéMON I'll get to see in the next=CONTEST. The anticipation of it thrills!
Are your friends strong?
Your friends are, indeed, strong.
Friends need not be human.
For me, POKéMON are treasured friends!
Child...
Did you knock on the door?
A loss is to be accepted without haste
or panic.
To be never ruffled in any situation is
the GENTLEMAN's code of conduct.
JED: I feel a little shy about this, but...
We'll show you our lovey-dovey power!
JED: Sigh...
JED: It's the first time that our lovey-
dovey power couldn't prevail!=You must be an awesome TRAINER!
JED: You only have one POKéMON?
Isn't that just too lonesome?
LEA: I feel a little silly, but...
We'll show you our lovey-dovey power!
LEA: Oh, boo!
LEA: I can't believe it!
Our lovey-dovey power failed...=You must be an awesome TRAINER!
LEA: I wanted to battle...
But you don't even have two POKéMON...
Ah, you've come just in time.
I'm bored, you see.
You may entertain me.
...That will do.
Perhaps I shall get Father to acquire
a yacht for me.=A yacht for me and POKéMON!
Oh, you're such an adorable TRAINER.
Would you like to have tea?=Or would you rather battle?
I see.
You're the active sort.
A world cruise on a luxury liner has its
charms, I must say...
But, I will admit there is an appealing
side to touring HOENN by ferry.
Uh... Hi! I... I'm not acting suspicious!
Uh... You can have this! For free!
It... Honestly, I didn't SNATCH it from
someone! I'd never do such a thing!=It's clean! You can use it!
SNATCH steals the foe's move in
advance, and then uses the snatched=move on the foe.
BATTLE TOWER
"Win it all and be the best, TRAINERS!"2
This is the BATTLE TOWER.
TRAINERS bring their best-raised
POKéMON for elimination-style matches.
Hello, are you here for the ferry?
May I see your TICKET?
LANDON doesn't have the TICKET...
I'm terribly sorry.
You must have a TICKET to board
the ferry.
LANDON flashed the TICKET.
Perfect! That's all you need!
And where would you like to go?
SLATEPORT CITY it is, then!
LILYCOVE CITY it is, then!
Please sail with us another time!
Please board the ferry and wait for
departure.
Then, where would you like to go?
I'm not leaving until I've beaten 35
TRAINERS in a row!
Gee, there're a lot of tough-looking
TRAINERS here.=I'm not good enough to enter yet...
Welcome to the BATTLE TOWER!
Please register with me to enter
a BATTLE ROOM.
Would you like to make a BATTLE ROOM
challenge?
We'll be looking forward to your
next challenge.
Before entering a BATTLE ROOM, your
progress must be saved. Is that okay?
There are two BATTLE ROOMS,
Level 50 and Level 100.=Which would you like to challenge?
Please select the POKéMON you wish
to enter.
I'll direct you to your BATTLE ROOM now.
The BATTLE TOWER is a facility made
especially for POKéMON battles.
Within the TOWER are many BATTLE ROOMS.
In each BATTLE ROOM, seven TRAINERS
await your challenge.
Beat all seven, and you will be rewarded
with a fabulous prize.
You may also take a break from your
challenge by saving your progress.
Make sure you save properly or you
won't be able to resume your challenge.
Excuse me!
You don't have three eligible POKéMON.
You must have three different POKéMON
of Level 50 or less to enter.
They also must be holding different
kinds of items.
EGGS@
 ineligible.
Please come see me when you are ready.
Excuse me!
You don't have three eligible POKéMON.
You must have three different POKéMON
to enter.
They also must be holding different
kinds of items.
EGGS@
 ineligible.
Please come see me when you are ready.
Excuse me!
You didn't save before you quit your
challenge last time.
Because of that, your challenge so far
has been disqualified. Sorry!
Congratulations!
You've beaten all seven TRAINERS!
For beating seven TRAINERS in a row,
you have earned this fabulous prize!
LANDON received the prize
Oh, your BAG appears to be full.
Please make room in your BAG, then come
see me.
Thank you for playing!
Your record will be saved.
Please wait.
We've been waiting for you!
Before entering a BATTLE ROOM, your
progress will be saved. Please wait.
You're finally about to face the
50th TRAINER.
From here on, every time you beat seven
TRAINERS in a row, your POKéMON will=receive a commemorative RIBBON.
Good luck!
Here are some RIBBONS for beating
seven tough TRAINERS in a row.
LANDON received some RIBBONS!
LANDON put the RIBBONS on the
challenger POKéMON.
Hello, hello!
You're going to battle here, right?
Can you tell me what's going through
your mind as you prepare for battle?
Oh, wow, you'll tell me?
Great! Then, what's your answer?
Oh, so you don't think much about it?
You're one cool customer.
Hunh? You changed your mind?
I guess you're fickle.
Okay, so that's how you feel?
That's quite original.
Thanks!
The number of matches you win in a row
is recorded.
The record is posted beside the
registration counter.
It's also on the back of your
TRAINER'S CARD.
Once you've entered the BATTLE TOWER,
you can't leave until you either lose=or you beat seven TRAINERS in a row.
You'd best be certain that you're up
to the challenge.
Hahahaha! Pure magnificence!
Pure magnificence indeed!
Do you realize what you've achieved?
You've beaten 50 TRAINERS in a row!
Yes, purely magnificent!
As the OWNER of the BATTLE TOWER,
let me give you a memento!
Wahahaha! Pure magnificence!
Absolutely pure magnificence indeed!
Do you realize what you've achieved?
You've beaten 100 TRAINERS in a row!
Yes, absolutely magnificent!
As the OWNER of the BATTLE TOWER,
let me give you a memento!
I suggest you keep it displayed.
It will surely attract attention.
Oh?
Your PC has no room for this...
But it would be a shame to waste this...
Please come back for this!
I'm overwhelmed with satisfaction after
seeing your magnificent performance.
It makes the building of the BATTLE
TOWER all worthwhile!
We will restore your POKéMON to
full health.
You will be facing opponent no. @
Are you ready?
Would you like to save and
quit the game?
Would you like to cancel your BATTLE
ROOM challenge?
Oh? You look like a good TRAINER.
Will you look at my POKéMON?
I'm not good enough for you.
I enjoyed our battle very much.
Please battle with me some other time.
Go!
Go, our POKéMON!
Oh... We couldn't win.
Did it surprise you that two POKéMON
battled at the same time?
You can't battle with us if you have
only one POKéMON.=Why? Because we're strong!
Hey, hey! This is my first battle in
a while. I'll give it my all!
But I gave it my all...
You're far too strong!
You must be a great TRAINER!
My POKéMON are extremely cute and
extremely strong.=Please allow me to show you.
I must concede defeat.
After all, you are strong.
The next time we meet, I will have raised
my POKéMON much more.
Don't expect mercy then!
We HIKERS are always full of energy!
My POKéMON are also full of energy, too.=We're always itching for a battle!
We ran out of energy...
Wahahah! Sure, we lost!
But we had a great battle, didn't we?=We're satisfied with that!
You look like a strong TRAINER,
but can you beat us?
Waaah!
We lost!
If two POKéMON can battle at the same
time, all sorts of new things can happen.
Do you only have one POKéMON that can
battle?
Then we can't battle with you yet.
Have you tried beating all the other
TRAINERS in battle?
Thanks for coming today!
I hope you're looking forward to this
game's release!
Huh? Did you battle with all the
TRAINERS already?
Thank you for coming today!
I hope you're looking forward to this
game's release!
I've never seen the POKéMON you have.
It makes me envious a little.
Look at all those TRAINERS!
They have different POKéMON, too.=And they're all waiting for you!
Welcome to the World of POKéMON!
May all POKéMON battles be bright,
fun, and ferocious!
I have to stay home today.
My big sisters had to go out.
They said it was for preparations.
In the autumn, we're going to start
a flower shop. Please wait for it!
I'm the owner of the SEASHORE HOUSE.
But you can call me MR. SEA!
What I love above all is to see hot
POKéMON battles.
Let me see that your heart burns hot!
If you can defeat all the TRAINERS
here, I'll reward your efforts.
Show me some hot matches!
I run this SEASHORE HOUSE just for
that reason alone!
You're scorching hot!
Those battles blazed!=I'm more than just satisfied!
As thanks for showing me your hot
streak, I want you to take these.
It's half a dozen bottles of SODA POP!
Oh, but hey, your BAG's jammed full.
I'll hang on to these for you.
Want to buy some SODA POP?
POKéMON love it!
Just $300 a bottle!
Buy some!
Here you go!
You don't have the money.
No?
That's too bad.
SODA POP! The POKéMON favorite!
Just $300 a bottle! Want one?
Here you go!
Oh, dear!
You don't have enough money.
That's too bad.
If you're looking for a battle on the
high seas, you'll find no hotter =TRAINER than me, matey!
That was a hot battle!
I can accept that loss, matey!
Whenever I'm in SLATEPORT, I enjoy
hot battles and ice-cold SODA POP!
Boring battles aren't worth the effort.
Fiery hot battles are what toughen up
TRAINERS and POKéMON!
That's hot!
Whew, I'm all thirsty.
Maybe I'll have a SODA POP.
I'm going to show you how great my
POKéMON are, but don't cry!
...I lost, but I won't cry...
If one of my POKéMON knew the move
for carrying me across water on its=back, I could get rid of this inner tube.
You're being watched...
Hah? Grrr...
How did you know I concealed myself
beneath this desk? You're sharp!
Hah? Grrr...
How did you know I concealed myself
behind this tree? You're sharp!
Hah? Grrr...
How did you know I concealed myself
in this dresser? You're sharp!
Hah? Grrr...
How did you know I concealed myself
beyond this window? You're sharp!
Hah? Grrr...
How did you know I concealed myself
in this planter? You're sharp!
Hah? Grrr...
How did you know I concealed myself
in this cupboard? You're sharp!
Hah? Grrr...
How did you know I concealed myself
behind this window? You're sharp!
Hah? Grrr...
How did you know I concealed myself
beneath this cushion? You're sharp!
Behold!
For I am the greatest living mystery
of a man in all of HOENN!=They call me...
The TRICK MASTER!
Wahahaha! Glad to meet you!
You, you've come to challenge my
TRICK HOUSE, haven't you?
That's why you're here, isn't it?
Yes, it is!
Consider your challenge accepted!
Enter through the scroll there,
and let your challenge commence!
I shall be waiting in the back!
It's a scroll.
There is a big hole behind the scroll!
Want to go in?
There is a note affixed to the scroll...
"I am leaving on a journey.
Don't look for me. TRICK MASTER"2
For the next time, I'll use this trick,
and that scheme, and those ruses...
Mufufufu... If I may say so, it's
brilliantly difficult, even for me!
Hah? What?!
Oh, it's you!
I'm in the midst of devising new tricky
challenges!
It's not too much to ask for a bit more
time for me to think, is it now?=You wouldn't begrudge me that?=Come back in a little while!
Ah, it's you! You're here to accept the
reward from before, isn't that right?=Yes, right I am!
Here!
I'll give it to you now!
Hah?
Did you not come to claim your reward?
MECHADOLL 5 I AM!
IF REWARD IS NOT TAKEN BY YOU,=THEN TRICK MASTER YOU CANNOT FOLLOW.
THEN FAREWELL.
YOUR PC STATUS: FULL AGAIN.
MEAN, YOU ARE.
LANDON found a scroll.
LANDON memorized the secret code
written on the scroll.
A secret code is written on it.
The door is locked.
...On closer inspection, this is written
on it: "Write the secret code here."2
Aak!
You've made it to me?=Hmmm... You're sharp!
It took me all night to plant all those
trees...
You're almost my equal in greatness by
one, two, three, four, five, six places!
It took me all night to make the maze...
You're almost my equal in greatness by
one, two, three, four, five places!
It took me all night to bring in those
boulders...
You're almost my equal in greatness by
one, two, three, four places!
It took me all night to shove in those
boulders...
You're almost my equal in greatness by
one, two, three places!
It took me all night to make MECHADOLLS
and another to think up the quiz...
You're almost my equal in greatness by
one, two places!
It took me all night to install
the doors...
You're almost my equal in greatness!
It took me all night setting up arrows...
You're my equal in greatness!
It took me all night polishing floors...
You're above me in greatness!
Possibly...
Wh-what should I do?
My fountain of ideas for tricks has=run dry...
Perhaps it is time I toured the country
on a quest to devise new tricks...
I hate to admit defeat, but you have
bested me!
Still, you must have been reeled in by
my charisma for you to visit me again=and again. Yes, you must have!
But that has nothing to do with my
losing!
In recognition of the friendship
between you, the driven, and the genius=that is myself, I demand that you take=this keepsake!
What? No room in your PC?
What am I to make of that?
I wish I could say that, but I am much
too kind and caring, so come back later!
... ... ... ... ... ...
I am leaving on a journey of discovery.
A quest in search of new tricks.
I wish that you will one day visit and
entertain me again.
And now, farewell!
Fine!
You have earned this reward!
What? Have you no room for this?
What manner of items do you carry?
But fine, since you've reached me,
your reward will be with me till later.
Scrub that smug smirk from your face!
It's much too early to think you've won!
I'll make new tricks to stump you, I will.
You may mock me only when you're done.
Come back for the next exciting
installment!
Now, now! You're ignoring me now?
Now that, I consider heartbreaking!
LANDON wrote down the secret code
on the door.
"TRICK MASTER is fabulous."2
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
The lock clicked open!
I'll hack and slash my way to victory
with the CUT we just learned!
Why are you so serious?
I never get tired of hacking
and slashing!
I wandered into this weird house
by accident...
And now I've lost...
I lost my way, I lost a battle, and I'm
even more lost... I can't get out...
Just who is the TRICK MASTER?
I lost while I was lost in thought!
You're strong!
Just who are you?
LANDON wrote down the secret code
on the door.
"TRICK MASTER is smart."2
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
The lock clicked open!
Which switch closes which hole?
After that battle, I'm even more
confused!
Can I get you to push all the buttons
for me?
Oh! You're on your second TRICK HOUSE
challenge!
You're good at battling too?
The TRICK MASTER rigged all the tricks
in this house all by himself.
I want to make my own GYM one day.
So, I'm studying how to set traps.
I didn't study battling enough!
You're strong, aren't you?
Maybe even enough to be a GYM LEADER!
LANDON wrote down the secret code
on the door.
"TRICK MASTER is coveted."2
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
The lock clicked open!
I keep coming back to this same place!
I'm already having trouble, and then
you have to beat me? It's not fair!
It's full of doors here!
It's too small and dark in here! Help!
I don't know what's going on here.
I'm starting to feel sad...
You... You're awful!
I know I'm weak!
And, I have no sense of direction!
I don't get it. What would anyone want
with a house this bizarre?
I don't get it.
How did I lose?
I don't get it.
How many traps are in this house?
You may be the one to solve that.
LANDON wrote down the secret code
on the door.
"TRICK MASTER is cool."2
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
The lock clicked open!
It's too much bother to think this out.
I only wanted to battle!
Even though I lost, I still like battling
the best!
Wouldn't you agree? You would go
anywhere if TRAINERS were there.
Heh! Boulders like this, I can brush
aside with one finger!
I can push boulders, but I can't solve
the puzzle...
It's not good enough to be brawny...
You have to use your head. Be brainy!
The TRICK HOUSE is getting trickier,
isn't it?
Aaak!
Has anyone made it to the end?
LANDON wrote down the secret code
on the door.
"TRICK MASTER is a genius."2

When I heard there was a strange
house, I had to check it out.
I've discovered a tough TRAINER!
I'm sure having a good time checking
this place out.
It's a challenge I've found worth
repeating!
Maybe I could get my BIRD POKéMON
to fly over the wall...
Gwaaah! I blew it!
Ehehehe... I guess I lost because I
was trying to cheat.
I'm getting dizzy from these rotating
doors...
Everything's spinning around and
around. I can't take this anymore...
You don't seem to be affected at all.
Or do you have your poker face on?
LANDON wrote down the secret code

"TRICK MASTER is huggable."2

The TRICK MASTER always vanishes
like smoke. How does he do it?
Aiyeeeh! You're much too strong!
How do you do it?
I wish I could appear and disappear as
if I were smoke, too.
Going around the same spot...
It begets ill fortune...
Defeated!
It's a bad sign...
I've circled the same spot over ten
times now... It's ill fortune...
Whoever wins will get through here
first. That's the feeling I get.
Oh!
Well, go ahead, then!
You're solving all the puzzles in the
TRICK HOUSE. That's the feeling I get.
LANDON wrote down the secret code

"TRICK MASTER I love."2

Not many TRAINERS have made it

That must mean you're tough, too...
You've beaten the POKéMON LEAGUE
CHAMPION? That's too much!
Consider yourself lucky to be

This isn't right!
I can't lose!
It's a miracle that you beat me.
You can brag about it.
You've been slugging through the TRICK
HOUSE challenge, too.
I see...
You possess an extraordinary style.
Seeing someone like you should please

This area is covered in volcanic ash,
huff-puff!
I'm specially gifted, huff-puff.
I make glass out of volcanic ash
and make items, huff-puff.
Go collect ashes with this, huff-puff.
Just take that SOOT SACK and walk
through piles of ash, huff-puff.
And it will fill up with the volcanic ash,
huff-puff.
Once you think you've collected a good
amount, come see me, huff-puff.
Have you collected ashes, huff-puff?
Let me see, huff-puff.
Hmmm...
There's not enough ash here, huff-puff.=I can't make glass with this, huff-puff.
Let's see... @

you'll need to walk for me to make you=a BLUE FLUTE, huff-puff.
Oh!
You've got a lot of ashes, huff-puff!
I'll make you a glass item, huff-puff!

Which item would you rather have me

You've collected all that ash, but you

Ah, I've finished your @

You have to keep it with you to collect
volcanic ash, huff-puff.
It's fun to blow a glass flute while my
boss is talking.
Huff-huff! Puff-puff!
The BOSS got interested in the
research they have going here, so he=sent us out.
You quit meddling!
Blast it...
Blasted by a kid...
Our BOSS knows everything.
But I'm just a GRUNT. What would I know
about what he's thinking?
Huh?
What's a kid doing here?
Huh?
I lost?!
Oh, no...
I'll catch an earful for losing to a kid...
I should just take a nap in the bed...
While I was sleeping, everyone went
upstairs!
Wow, you're really strong!
I wish I could be a POKéMON TRAINER
like you!
The PROFESSOR loves rain.
That's a fact.
But if it keeps raining, people will be in
trouble. That's another fact.
And thus, the PROFESSOR is studying
if the rain can be put to good use.
Hello!
We've been saved by your actions!
What I don't understand is what on
earth the @
S were up to.
There's a bed...
Let's take a rest.
The INSTITUTE created a type of
POKéMON that has something to do with=the weather. We're here to take them!
Our plan's being spoiled by a kid?
If the POKéMON they made here can
control the weather freely, then we of=TEAM @
 definitely need it!
We're TEAM @
We appear wherever anything rare is=found!
You got me!
You don't have any idea what we of
TEAM @
 are working towards!=You stay out of our way!
Ahahahaha!
You're going to meddle in TEAM @
affairs?
You're either absolutely fearless,
simply ignorant, or both!
You're so cute, you're disgusting!
I'll put you down, kiddy!
Ahahahaha!
You're disgustingly strong!
Ahahahaha!
We got meddled with unexpectedly!
We're out of options.
We'll have to pull out.
But this isn't the last you'll see of
TEAM @
! We have other plans!=Don't you forget it!
Thanks!
Thanks to you, we're safe!
It might be an odd way of thanking you,
but take this POKéMON.
Hm? You don't seem to have any room
for this POKéMON.
LANDON received CASTFORM!
That POKéMON changes shape according
to the weather conditions.
There're plenty of them in the
INSTITUTE - go ahead and take it.
I've been researching rain for many
years, but it's ridiculous to think that=humans can freely change the weather.
I heard about a cave called the CAVE
OF ORIGIN.
People rumor that the spirits of
POKéMON are revived there.=Could something like that really happen?
WINGULL: Pihyo?
I'm the DIVING TREASURE HUNTER!
I'm the awesome dude who makes
deep-sea dives to gather treasures=resting at the bottom.
Tell me, have you seen any SHARDS of
tools made in ancient times?
You haven't got any treasures
for me...
If you see any SHARDS, like the RED
SHARD, you've got to trade it with me!
Oh, hey! That...
That's a SHARD! I'm looking for those!
Oh, man, you've got to trade that
with me! I'll give you something good!
What do you want to trade?
You'll trade your @
 for
my @
, then?
It's a done deal!
Use that wisely!
Do you want to trade something else?
Whoops, your BAG's full.
Get rid of some items, friend!
No? That's a downer.
Well, if you change your mind, come back.

Welcome to my POKéMON LAB.
I carry out research on battling in
secrecy.
Would you like to see how strong I am?
I'm going to go all out!
Oh.
Some other time, then!
Hmm... I've still got lots to learn.
I have to study some more.
Thanks for battling with me.
Please come back again tomorrow.
Welcome to my POKéMON LAB.
I carry out research on battling in
secrecy.
A big mansion is nice, but I like this
sort of place more.
I like it because all kinds of people
come visit me.
So, how would you like a battle?
That's the way!
When you're ready, give me a shout!
Aww! Done in!
But it's still fun to battle!
Well, anyway, I should go buy some
decorations and furniture.
I want my SECRET BASE to be a place
other people can enjoy.
A big mansion is nice, but I like this
sort of place more.
I like it because all kinds of people
come visit me.
I simply adore shopping for decorations
and furniture.
I also love raising POKéMON just
as much.
If you would be so kind, will you battle
with my POKéMON?
Thank you.
Shall we begin?
Oh.
How disappointing...
I concede...
That was all in good fun!
I should go enjoy shopping now.
I simply adore shopping for decorations
and furniture.
I also love raising POKéMON just
as much.
Some people make their SECRET BASES in
hard-to-find places.=Do they want to just lie low?
But since you found me, how about we
have a battle?
I'm not going down easily!
Oh... Are you maybe tired from searching
for this place?
I went down...
Where's your SECRET BASE?
I should go visit you there.
Some people make their SECRET BASES in
hard-to-find places.=Do they want to just lie low?
People have told me that you can get
decorations in several ways.
We should have a race to see who can
get nicer decorations and furniture!
In the meantime, want to battle?
This is my SECRET BASE.
I can't lose!
I'll battle with you anytime.
Huh?
Did I just lose?
I won't lose at collecting decorations.
Come visit again!
People have told me that you can get
decorations in several ways.

I found a spot I liked, and I did it up
with my favorite decorations.
I raise my favorite POKéMON and grow
stronger with it.
That's what I do.
Want to battle with me?
Show me what you're made of!
I guess there are times when you're not
into it.
I know exactly what you're made of now.
We can both become stronger.
Let's keep at it!
I found a spot I liked, and I did it up

Are you speechless?
Want to see my taste in battling?
There's no holding back!
I'll be happy to demonstrate my style
anytime.
You're supremely talented!
Your power seems to be limitless...

I'll keep on polishing it!

What's that?
What am I doing?
I'm thinking about making my own room
here using a POKéMON move.
I know! I'll give you this TM.
Will you use it to make your own room?
Find a big tree that looks like it might
drop some vines.
Use SECRET POWER in front of the tree.
Some vines should get free and drop=down, so you can climb the tree.
You'll find a lot of space for putting
your favorite things.
It'll be your own secret room...
A SECRET BASE!
You should make one, too.
Another thing, you don't always have
to make your SECRET BASE in a tree.
Try using SECRET POWER on rock walls
that have small indents in them.
I'm going to look for other places, too.
Okay, bye!
Oh, you don't want this?
If you change your mind, tell me, okay?
Oh, you don't have any room for this.
I'll hold on to it, so come back for it

A CONTEST has two stages of judging,

Primary judging is a popularity poll

The primary and secondary scores are

The POKéMON garnering the highest
score is declared the winner.
There are five kinds of CONTESTS.

the POKéMON you plan to enter.
There are four ranks of POKéMON
CONTESTS.
NORMAL, SUPER, HYPER and MASTER

enter.
Any POKéMON that won a NORMAL Rank
CONTEST may move up the SUPER Rank in=the same category.
In the same way, a SUPER Rank winner
can move up to the HYPER Rank, and a=HYPER Rank winner can advance to the=MASTER Rank in the same category.
A POKéMON that won in the MASTER Rank
may compete in the MASTER Rank as=often as its TRAINER wants.

Briefly, how would you describe the

Until next time, see you!
Introducing the TRAINER's @
Hello! You're the TRAINER who just had
a battle, right?
I'm gathering interviews with TRAINERS
all over the place.
May I get a few words from you about
your impressions on battling?
You will? Really?
Thank you!=Then, uh...
How did things turn out in the BATTLE
TOWER today?
Were you satisfied with the battle?
Or are you unhappy?
Oh...
Sorry we disturbed you.
Please give us an interview the next
time you visit the BATTLE TOWER.
Well, of course!
That unmistakable look of satisfaction
on your face...
It's obvious that you've had a great
battle.
Oh, I see...
Well, it certainly is difficult to make a
battle turn out exactly as planned.
Oh, oh, may I ask one more question?
If you were to describe your
impressions about this battle with one=saying, what would it be?
Oh, that is stunningly cool!
That's a great line!
I hope you'll do great next time, too.
I hope to see you again!
Oh, I see...
Still, being the silent type is also cool,
isn't it?
I hope you'll give me the opportunity to
share your thoughts again!
I'll be looking forward to your next
battle!
Yeah!
It's BRAVO TRAINER time!
Today, we're going to profile @
who took the BATTLE TOWER challenge!
For the challenge, @

 so early in the challenge.
We asked the TRAINER for impressions
on the match with @
The twosome won it all by defeating
's @
 thoroughly.=Bravo, TRAINER!
Knocking off even @
...
It defies belief! Simply astounding!
We asked the TRAINER for impressions
on the moment of glory.
After a string of wins, the pair finally
succumbed to @
's @
,=their final hurdle.
Nice try, TRAINER!
Still, you have to give credit.
You don't see many famous combinations=like @
 and @
We asked the TRAINER for impressions
on battling the celebrity pair.
This is what the TRAINER had to say:
"I'm satisfied!"2
Now isn't that a refreshing reply?
Bravo, TRAINER!
Isn't it out-and-out awesome to be able
to battle to full satisfaction?
I found out exactly how satisfied
when I heard the TRAINER say this:
This is what the TRAINER had to say:
"I'm not satisfied..."2
Our TRAINER was obviously a little down
when that was uttered.
Still, it's not easy to be able to battle
with complete satisfaction, am I right?
Anyway, I found out how dissatisfied
our TRAINER was when I heard this:
None
None
None
None

."2
Now isn't that great?
It really expresses @
's joy,
I'd say.
That battle with @

end... It really was what you'd call="@
"2!

Now isn't that fitting?
That battle with @
 at the
end... You can't describe it as anything=else but "@
"2!

loud and clear, I'd say!

It should be aired sometime, I think,

Hmmm...
I've got a good story for a TV program.
I'd better write it up in a hurry!
Hello, it's time for RECENT HAPPENINGS.
For POKéMON TRAINERS, every day is
a storybook tale.
What we want to do is to introduce you
to some of these POKéMON tales.
Today, we bring you the story of the
TRAINER @
What did @
 experience recently?
Let's find out.
Let's see...
Wasn't that enlightening?
The story gives you a clear idea of what
 has experienced recently.=It's as if we were there as witnesses!
."2 That
accents the tale and gives it depth.
."2
That gives the tale a sense of place.=It lets us envision the tale's setting.
The "@
section of the tale is very expressive.
 has recounted a wonderful
tale involving POKéMON.
And now @
's tale is indelibly
etched into your soul, too.
That's it for today.
Please tune in next time.
Greetings!
It's time for POKéMON NEWS.
We've just received word of a very
rare occurrence.
There have been reports of a mass
outbreak of @
 in the vicinity=of @
, as you're probably aware,
is known as a POKéMON that's rare=and hard to find.
It sounds like a rare opportunity to
see the mystifying outbreak of=@
 in the wild.
That's the news on POKéMON NEWS.
And now, it's time for...
THE NAME RATER SHOW.
I tell your POKéMON's fortune from
the nickname you've bestowed.
Advice is what I have to give, and it is
helpful advice that I offer.
Today, I shall prophesize the nickname
 of @
's POKéMON=@
Hmhm...
Hmm...
This nickname is...
A nickname that hints at talent in many
different ways.
I urge this TRAINER to take courage
and take on many challenges.
A nickname that perfectly complements
, the TRAINER's name.
It suggests that you will forge a fine
partnership with precise timing.
A nickname fit for a unique individual
of a POKéMON!
If raised properly, this POKéMON's
uniqueness will bloom excessively!
A nickname that will nurture the caring
and compassionate side of POKéMON.
If raised properly, this POKéMON will
come to exhibit real warmth!
A very fine nickname that hints at
greatness to come.
I am intrigued about what the future
holds in store for this POKéMON.
A good nickname that should make the
POKéMON hale and hearty!
That POKéMON should remain fit and
robust for a long, long time.
A good nickname that should make the
POKéMON very active!
I should think that this POKéMON will be
a strong performer in battles.
An appealing nickname that should make
the POKéMON very charming!
I don't doubt that this POKéMON will be
quite the charmer in POKéMON CONTESTS.
The nickname @
 is rooted by
the letter "@
."2
That letter is supported by the first
letter "@
,"2 which gives it a solid sense=of presence as a nickname.
The nickname @
 is very
shapely in a pleasing manner.
The presence of the letters "@
"2 and
"2 - now that is remarkably good!
The nickname @
 - it has a
sublime, flowing feel to it.
The flow from the initial letter "@
"2 to
"2 is especially wonderful.
Let's examine other examples of fine
nicknames, shall we?
Try this example. Take a part of the
TRAINER name of @
, and end=up with the fine nickname @
The nickname @
 would also work
quite well.
The POKéMON's species name of
 could be used as the basis=for making the nickname @
 would also be an effective
nickname.
What should always be avoided is using
another POKéMON species name.
For instance, avoid taking the name of
 to make the nickname @
.=That is unacceptable.
But I must say, @
 has a most
remarkable flair for devising nicknames.
It is my hope that the TRAINER will
continue to treat @
 with love.
That's it for today's show.
May we meet again.

It's time for TODAY'S SMART SHOPPER.
INTERVIEWER: How are you, viewers?
Today we're visiting the POKéMON MART
in @
Let's check on what the hot sellers
have been recently.
Let's interview the clerk to get the
lowdown.
Hi, how's your business?
CLERK: Oh, we're doing excellent.
Recently, @
 has been selling
especially strongly.
Why, just the other day a TRAINER
named @
 bought @
INTERVIEWER: The TRAINER bought
S? That's a haul!
If I may say so, @
 must have
been stocking up for a long journey=to far-off places.
For traveling, @
S are so
important!
INTERVIEWER: Speaking of the item
, I just bought @
 of=them recently.
After all, @
's a great item!
INTERVIEWER: @
But @
 of them?!
I didn't think there would be anyone
buying that many.
My goodness, I can only afford one or
two at a time...
INTERVIEWER: One time, I bought
a whole lot of the item @
But it turned out to be too many.
I ended up regretting it...
Since then, I only buy strictly what
I absolutely need...
Oops!
There's no point talking about me!
CLERK: @
 also bought the item
 in bulk, taking @
INTERVIEWER: Oh, that's smart.
's a very good item, too.

business. It's almost overwhelming.
Recently, a TRAINER named @

in bulk.
The TRAINER almost cleared out our
entire stock of @
I never dreamt that any customer
would ever need so many @
S.=It's just unheard of!
INTERVIEWER: So that would be like 100
or 200 sold?
CLERK: Oh, no, much more than that!
INTERVIEWER: Oh, my goodness!
 must be a special shopper!
CLERK: @
 is a VIP customer,
no doubt about it.
INTERVIEWER: Hmm...
That is amazing.
But why would the TRAINER need to buy
so many?
... ...
The mystery deepens, but this is all
the time we have today.=See you on our next broadcast!
Still, @
 is certainly an enigma...
THE WORLD OF MASTERS
Hello, viewers.
Perhaps you are aware of a TRAINER
named @
 is famous as a master at
catching POKéMON.
's quest for POKéMON depends
entirely on a careful search on foot.
On one memorable day, the TRAINER
walked some @
 steps.
The total number of POKéMON caught
that day reached an impressive @
That remarkable feat must have been
possible because of the trust between=the TRAINER and @
The master caught the day's last

That POKéMON apparently enjoys
a special status as a record holder.
Skilled TRAINERS should be encouraged
to challenge this fine record.
That's all for today.

GABBY: Oh! We've just spotted a tough-
looking TRAINER here of all places!
Okay, roll camera!
Let's get this interview.
GABBY: Oh! You're LANDON! Hi!
Do you remember us from last time?
Can you show us how much stronger
you've become? Okay, cue interview!
GABBY: My eyes didn't lie!
I did discover an astonishing TRAINER!
GABBY: Awesome! Awesome!
Who are you?!
I knew we were onto something wild
when we spotted you!
Oh, please let me explain. We travel
around everywhere interviewing all=sorts of TRAINERS.
So, would you give us a bit of your time
for an interview?
GABBY: "@
!"2
Do you remember? That's the quote you
gave us as the battle clincher last time.
I never, ever forget stuff like that!
The last time we battled, you stomped
us before we could brace ourselves...
Anyway, what do you think?
Do you want to be interviewed again?
The last time we battled, didn't you
throw a POKé BALL at us?
We were shocked! So we told everyone,
just everyone, about it!
Anyway, what do you think?
Do you want to be interviewed again?
The last time we battled, your item
skills cleverly did us in.
Anyway, what do you think?
Do you want to be interviewed again?
The last time we battled, we managed
to look respectable.
Anyway, what do you think?
Do you want to be interviewed again?
Anyway, what do you think?
Do you want to be interviewed again?
You will?
Thank you!
Okay, I need you to describe your
feelings about our battle, but it=has to be short and sweet. Go!
GABBY: Mmm, yeah!
That's the perfect clincher!
I get the feeling that this will make
a great TV show.
There's a chance that they'll air this
on TV, so make sure to look for us!
Okay!
We'll be seeing you!
GABBY: Oh...
Okay, but don't give up!
We'll be keeping an eye out for you!
GABBY: We'll be keeping an eye out
for you!
GABBY: Is there a strong TRAINER
anywhere with a lot of POKéMON?
GABBY: Wow, you are something!
You've gotten a lot stronger - a lot -
since we last battled.
We were right about you when we
spotted you as a hot TRAINER.
So, anyway, what do you think?
Are you willing to give us an interview=this time?
GABBY: That was an intense battle!
Did you get all that on camera?
TY: Hey, lookie here! A tough-looking
TRAINER here, of all places!=Camera's rolling!
TY: Hey, lookie here!
I remember you!
I'll get this battle all on this
here camera!
TY: You're a natural!
Got me some prime footage right here!
TY: Do you only have the one POKéMON
and that's it?
If you had more POKéMON, it'd make for
better footage, but...
TY: Yep, we sure spotted a hot TRAINER.
This is a huge scoop for us!
TY: Yep, I got it all.
That whole battle's on camera.
IN SEARCH OF TRAINERS...
GABBY: Hi! Today I'm visiting an area
near @
We're trying to spot some up-and-coming
new talent in the field.
Today, we turned our lens on the
TRAINER LANDON.
There's something about this TRAINER
that piqued our interest.
We've battled LANDON before, but we
can attest that the TRAINER has most=definitely improved from before.
I knew we were onto someone special
when we spotted this TRAINER!
The best way to determine how strong
a TRAINER is...
Well, the fastest way is to battle.
And so we began our investigation!
... ...
That's how we ended up in battle
with LANDON.
In a dominating performance, we were
flattened, rolled up, and tossed aside!
LANDON is ruthlessly strong...
We asked the TRAINER for a succinct
summation of the battle we shared.
The combination of @
 and
 was divine!
The sight of them - @
 and
 - selflessly supporting=each other in the thick of battle...
It was a marvelous sight to behold!
 was the move the TRAINER
used last in our battle.
The move @
 is @
and @
's sign of friendship!
...I lost confidence in myself as
a result of our encounter.
We were beaten before we could launch
a single attack.=Ohhh... Snivel...
In spite of that, LANDON's battles
are worth seeing.
I recommend confident TRAINERS to
challenge LANDON.
There's only one thing to be said.
Don't you dare throw a POKé BALL during=a TRAINER battle!
LANDON is certainly strong, but has
no clue about the basic rules.
To our TV audience, I have a request.
If you see LANDON, please caution
the TRAINER!
LANDON is adept at reading the
opponent's actions.
The timing of item usage was remarkably
effective!
Honestly speaking, I thought that
I might even be pretty good.
While we did end up losing, we did have
a hotly contested battle.
But if you're struggling against me,
you have a ways to go, LANDON!
After our battle, we asked LANDON for
a succinct summary.
The TRAINER replied, "@
."2
LANDON's POKéMON @
 and
...=And "@
"2...
Mmm! That's deep! There's deep
significance behind that quote!
It's no surprise - a good TRAINER has
good things to say.
That's all for today!
See you again on our next broadcast!

Can I interest you in something else?

I'm the STORYTELLER.
I'll tell you tales of legendary=TRAINERS.
Will you hear my tale?
Oh...
I feel stifled...
I know of these legends.
Which tale will you have me tell?
But, I know of no legendary TRAINERS.
Hence, I know no tales.
Where does one find a TRAINER worthy
of a legendary tale?
What's that?!
You... You...
 time(s)?!
That is indeed magnificent!
It's the birth of a new legend!
It gets me thinking, could there be
other TRAINERS with more impressive=legends awaiting discovery?
Are you a TRAINER?
Then tell me, have you any tales that
are even remotely legendary?
Incidentally... Would you care to hear
another legendary tale?
Hmm...
I'm not satisfied...
I wish you would bring me news worthy

I wish more people would be interested
in hearing my epic tales of legendary=TRAINERS.

Bye-bye!

BARD testing!
Hi, I'm the BARD.
Would you like to hear my song?
Oh...
You've left me feeling the blues...
Oh, what a moving song...
I wish I could play it for others...
So?
How do you like my song?
But I'm none too happy about the
lyrics.
How would you like to write some new
lyrics for me?
Oh...
You've left me feeling the blues...
Thank you kindly!
Let me sing it for you.
Was that how you wanted your song
to go?
Okay! That's it, then.
I'll sing this song for a while.
Hey, yo! They call me the HIPSTER.
I'll teach you what's hip and happening.
But, hey, I taught you what's hip and
happening already.
I'd like to spread the good word to
other folks.
But, hey, you already know a lot about
what's hip and happening.
I've got nothing new to teach you!
Hey, have you heard about

Hello there, TRAINER!
You've got a wonderful smile, there.
I have a hobby - collecting the profiles
of POKéMON TRAINERS.
So, how about it?
May I see your profile?
You make your own profile by putting
together four words or phrases.
Here, I'll show you an example of a
profile using four pieces of text.
You can switch those four pieces with
other text pieces any which way you=like to make your own profile.
There are a lot of text pieces that you
can use.
They are arranged in groups like
POKéMON, lifestyles, and hobbies so=it is easier to look them up.
So, first, choose the group of text
pieces to display a list of choices.
Then, pick the choice you want.
Repeat for the remaining text choices,
and you'll have your very own profile.
Yes! Thank you!
May I see your profile?
Oh, no, really?
I imagine someone like you would have
a wonderful profile...
Oh? You're not into it right now?
Well, anytime is good by me!
Hello there, TRAINER!
You've got a wonderful smile.
May I see your new profile?
Yes! Thank you!
I hope it's even better than the profile
you showed me before.
Oh, you like your profile the way it is.
I don't blame you - it's a wonderful
profile the way it is now.
F-fantastic!
Your profile, it's wonderful!
It really says what you're about.
Why, anyone hearing this profile would
be captivated by you!
Thank you!
Oh?
You know the secret saying!
That means you're now a fellow member
of the MYSTERY EVENT CLUB!

The power contained in the
METEORITE...
By amplifying its power with this
machine, MT. CHIMNEY's volcanic activity=will stop.
Fufufu... Eventually, the cooled-down
crater will fill with rainwater, giving=WATER POKéMON a place to live.
ARCHIE: You again...
Now listen.
All life depends on the sea.
The sea is everything!
Its importance is paramount!
That is why we of TEAM AQUA are
committed to expanding the sea.
Doing so will result in the emergence
of new POKéMON species.
We will return the world back to
nature for the good of POKéMON.
That is TEAM AQUA's vision!
I can't allow an ignorant child like
you to get in our way.
I, ARCHIE, will show you the
consequences of meddling!
What?!
I, ARCHIE, was caught off guard?!
ARCHIE: Ah, whatever.
I will give up our plans for MT.=CHIMNEY for the time being...
But no one can ever stop us!
TEAM AQUA will prevail!
Don't you ever forget that!
Hehehe!
So you've come all the way here!
But you're too late!
I've already delivered the METEORITE=from METEOR FALLS to the BOSS!
Hehehe...
So I lost...
I'm sure glad I never took you on back
at METEOR FALLS.
Hehehe!
You might have beaten me, but you don't
stand a chance against the BOSS!
If you get lost now, you won't have to
face a sound whipping!
We of TEAM AQUA are working hard for
everyone's sake.
Like, if there's more water around,
WATER POKéMON will be happy, and it'll=give people more fun places to swim!
Hunh?
What do you mean I lost?
Our BOSS says, "It will make everyone
happy."2
But why does everyone keep getting
in our way?
That annoying TEAM MAGMA...
They always mess with our plans!
METEORITES pack amazing power!
Go! Stomp TEAM MAGMA!
And expand the sea!
Stay out of our way, okay?
We're trying to enlarge the sea for
the good of everybody!
Yeah!
Hose them down!
We're going to keep expanding the sea!
Bushaa!
MAXIE: Oh, LANDON
Please, you must stop TEAM AQUA
for me!
They're trying to make this volcano
inactive by using the stolen=METEORITE's power!
MAXIE: LANDON
Please, you've got to stop TEAM AQUA
for me!
Dealing with these three thugs is
a lot, even for me!
MAXIE: LANDON
! Thank you!
With your help, we thwarted TEAM
AQUA's destructive plan!
But... This victory doesn't mean the
end of their evil plans.
We will remain vigilant and keep up
our pursuit of TEAM AQUA.
LANDON
, we shall meet again!
Darn... TEAM AQUA outnumbers us!
We can't keep up with them!
If they expand the sea, there'll be less
habitats for POKéMON and people!
TEAM AQUA wants to expand the sea...
How's that for insane?
Bufoh!
The power contained in the METEORITE...
By amplifying its power with this
machine, MT. CHIMNEY's volcanic activity=will instantly intensify...
Fufufu... The volcano will erupt, spewing
lava that will cool and harden.=It will expand the landmass...
MAXIE: You again...
Now listen.
We humans have grown on dry land.
The land is everything!
Its importance is paramount!
That is why we of TEAM MAGMA are
committed to expanding the landmass.
It will create space for new species
of POKéMON to evolve.
It will give us humans more space to
advance.
That is TEAM MAGMA's vision!
I can't allow an ignorant child like
you to get in our way.
I, MAXIE, will show you the

ARCHIE: Hold it right there.
ARCHIE: Fufufu...
So it was you, after all.
ARCHIE: Behold!
See how beautiful it is, the sleeping
form of the ancient POKéMON KYOGRE!
I have waited so long for this day to
come...
ARCHIE: It surprises me, how you've
managed to chase me here.
But that's all over now.
For the realization of my dream,
you must disappear now!
I...
I lost again?
ARCHIE: Fufufu...
I commend you. I must recognize that
you are truly gifted.
But!
I have this in my possession!
With this RED ORB, I can make KYOGRE...
The RED ORB suddenly began shining
by itself!
ARCHIE: What?!
I didn't do anything.
Why did the RED ORB...
Where did KYOGRE go?
ARCHIE: Hm? It's a message from our
members outside...
ARCHIE: Yes, what is it?
Hm...
It's raining heavily?
Good... That should have happened.
That is why we awakened KYOGRE,=to realize TEAM AQUA's vision of=expanding the sea.
What?!
It's raining far harder than we
envisioned? You're in danger?
That can't be...
That's just not possible...
Hold your position and monitor the
situation!
ARCHIE: There's something wrong...
The RED ORB is supposed to awaken
and control KYOGRE...
But... Why?
Why did KYOGRE disappear?
Why?!
MAXIE: What have you wrought?
ARCHIE... You've finally awoken KYOGRE,
haven't you?
What will happen to the world if this
downpour continues for all eternity?
The world's landmass will drown in
the deepening sea...
ARCHIE: What are you saying?
The RED ORB should let me control
KYOGRE...=That can't be possible...
MAXIE: We don't have the time to
argue about it here!
Get outside and see for yourself!
See if what you've wrought is the
world that you desired!
MAXIE: LANDON
, come on, you have
to get out of here, too!
MAXIE: Hold it right there.
MAXIE: Fufufu...
So it was you, after all.

Good... That should have happened.

This is the last you've seen of me...
I'll show you exactly how scary
TEAM AQUA can be!
So you think you can stand up alone
to TEAM AQUA's might...
Yeah, so you are strong...
But there're a lot of us!
What's up with you?
What does a single kid expect to do?
Dang...
Too strong...
You don't know anything.
Quit messing around with us!
Hey, I remember you from MT. CHIMNEY!
It's payback time!
Urgggh...
Beaten by some kid again!
Heh, it doesn't matter!
We bought ourselves some time!
The BOSS should have snatched what
he was after!
ARCHIE: Not you again...
You've impeded our plans repeatedly,
but this time you're too late.
The RED ORB that rested atop
MT. PYRE...=I, ARCHIE, claim it as mine!
Fufufu... Finally, I can realize my
grand design...
Come on, crew!
It's SLATEPORT next!
Oh, no...
This cannot happen...
How could they take the RED ORB?
The BLUE ORB and RED ORB must never
be separated. They belong together.
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
Hmm...
Fine!
You take the remaining BLUE ORB.
Please take after that foul man and
get the other ORB back!
The BLUE ORB you have been entrusted
with and the stolen RED ORB...
They must never be apart...
Something terrible will happen...
So...
KYOGRE has awoken...
The wondrous ORB that is said to have
becalmed the raging KYOGRE...=It is the BLUE ORB you bear.
That BLUE ORB was found buried inside
the CAVE OF ORIGIN in SOOTOPOLIS...
There is perhaps a link between
KYOGRE and the CAVE OF ORIGIN...
That man, he returned the RED ORB.
Are you going to return the BLUE ORB
to its rightful place, too?
What's that?!
If the balance is not restored, there
is no telling what could happen.
You will return the BLUE ORB to its
rightful place, yes?
LANDON handed the BLUE ORB to the
old woman.
Yes...
The two ORBS should remain here.
It is how it should be for the good
of all HOENN...
The spirit of the sea...
That is what KYOGRE is said to be in
POKéMON form...
In the same manner that we and POKéMON
have life, the sea is alive...
KYOGRE has taught us that...
MT. PYRE is where we calm the spirits
of POKéMON that have passed on...
This is a high place where one can
see all of HOENN...
The disembodied spirits of POKéMON
must find solace here...
Is it coincidence that you are here...
Will you hear out my tale? A tale long
told in the HOENN region?
It happened long, long ago...
The world was wracked by a ferocious
clash between the POKéMON of the sea=and the POKéMON of the land...
The POKéMON of the sea raised huge
waves and carved out oceans...
The POKéMON of the land raised
mountains and created continents...
Their fierce duel raged without end.
The world was engulfed in massive
infernos and vicious storms.
The BLUE ORB and the RED ORB brought
an end to the calamity.
Light poured from the two ORBS and
becalmed the enraged adversaries.
The pair, made docile, dove deep into
the sea where eventually they=disappeared...
I see...
Well, that, too, is fine...
ARCHIE: You...
So you stopped KYOGRE...
I shouldn't be surprised...
I understand now that humans cannot
freely control the balance between=the land and the sea...
So I have come to return the
RED ORB...
I doubt that we will cross paths again...
Farewell...
I'll show you exactly how scary
TEAM MAGMA can be!
So you think you can stand up alone
to TEAM MAGMA's might...
Yeah, so you are strong...
But there're a lot of us!
What's up with you?
What does a single kid expect to do?
Dang...
Too strong...
You don't know anything.
Quit messing around with us!
Hey, I remember you from MT. CHIMNEY!
It's payback time!
Urgggh...
Beaten by some kid again!
Heh, it doesn't matter!
We bought ourselves some time!
The BOSS should have snatched what
he was after!
MAXIE: Not you again...
You've impeded our plans repeatedly,
but this time you're too late.
The BLUE ORB that rested atop
MT. PYRE...=I, MAXIE, claim it as mine!
Fufufu... Finally, I can realize my
grand design...
Come on, crew!
It's SLATEPORT next!
Oh, no...
This cannot happen...
How could they take the BLUE ORB?
The BLUE ORB and RED ORB must never

... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
Hmm...
Fine!
You take the remaining RED ORB.
Please take after that foul man and
get the other ORB back!
The RED ORB you have been entrusted
with and the stolen BLUE ORB...
They must never be apart...
Something terrible will happen...
So...
GROUDON has awoken...
The wondrous ORB that is said to have
becalmed the raging GROUDON...=It is the RED ORB you bear.
That RED ORB was found buried inside
the CAVE OF ORIGIN in SOOTOPOLIS...
There is perhaps a link between
GROUDON and the CAVE OF ORIGIN...
That man, he returned the BLUE ORB.
Are you going to return the RED ORB
to its rightful place, too?
What's that?!

rightful place, yes?
LANDON handed the RED ORB to the
old woman.
Yes...
The two ORBS should remain here.
It is how it should be for the good
of all HOENN...
The spirit of the land...
That is what GROUDON is said to be in
POKéMON form...
In the same manner that we and POKéMON
have life, this very land is alive...
GROUDON has taught us that...
MT. PYRE is where we calm the spirits
of POKéMON that have passed on...
This is a high place where one can
see all of HOENN...
The disembodied spirits of POKéMON
must find solace here...

The world was engulfed in vicious
storms and massive infernos.
The RED ORB and the BLUE ORB brought
an end to the calamity.
Light poured from the two ORBS and
becalmed the enraged adversaries.
The pair, made docile, burrowed deep
under the ground where eventually=they disappeared...
I see...
Well, that, too, is fine...
MAXIE: You...
So you stopped GROUDON...
I shouldn't be surprised...
I understand now that humans cannot
freely control the balance between=the land and the sea...

If I had some BERRIES left over,
I'd gladly give you one...
But, I don't have any to spare today.
We'll have to do this another time.

You should use some

You should get a

come see me.
Let's get blending already!
I wonder what kind of

This is so exciting!

If you have POKéMON with you, then
you're an official POKéMON TRAINER!=You can't say no to my challenge!
Arrgh, I lost...
I should have trained mine more...
Listen, you. If you're strong, you
should have told me before!
Ever since I lost to you, I desperately
trained my POKéMON.=You can't say no to my challenge!
Arrgh, I lost...
Is my training method not right?
If you're going to get stronger, I'll
get stronger, too.
Did you just become a TRAINER?
We're both beginners!
I called you because I thought I
could beat you...
I haven't won once yet...
I wish I would win soon...
Hahah! Our eyes met!
I'll take you on with my BUG POKéMON!
Ow! Down and out!
If you lock eyes with a TRAINER,
you have to challenge! It's a rule!
I'm going to keep winning and aim
to be the best TRAINER.
Help me further my career!
I ended up furthering your career...
To keep winning my way up, I see that
I have to catch more POKéMON.
Did you feel the tug of our soul-
soothing fragrance?
You weren't led astray by our aroma...
Aromatherapy is a form of mental
healing that works with fragrances.
AMY: I'm AMY.
And this is my little sister LIV.=We battle together!
AMY: Uh-oh, we lost.
AMY: You have to think about all
kinds of things when you're battling=against two TRAINERS.
AMY: Uh-oh, you have only one
POKéMON with you.=You can't battle us like that.
LIV: We battle together as one
team.
LIV: Oh, we lost, big sister...
LIV: We work perfectly together, me
and my big sister...
But we still lost...
LIV: If you want to battle us, you
have to have two POKéMON!=It's not fair if you don't!
AMY: I'm AMY.
And this is my little sister LIV.=We battle together!
AMY: Aww, boo!
We couldn't win again...
AMY: You have to think about all
kinds of things when you're battling=against two TRAINERS.
AMY: Uh-oh, you have only one
POKéMON with you.=You can't battle us like that.
LIV: We battle together as one
team.
LIV: Awww, we lost again...
Big sister...
LIV: We work perfectly together, me
and my big sister...
But why did we lose again?
LIV: If you want to battle us, you
have to have two POKéMON!=It's not fair if you don't!
Gah! My fishing line's all snarled up!
I'm getting frustrated and mean!=That's it! Battle me!
Gah! Lost it!
I'm even more annoyed now!
Gah, I'm still boiling mad...
Grrrrr...
My POKéMON is delightfully adorable!
Don't be shy - I'll show you!
Oh, my gosh!
My darling POKéMON!
My delightful POKéMON looks darling
even when it's fainted!
Hi, you! My delightfully adorable
POKéMON has become more darling!
Oh!
My darling POKéMON!
The more I spend time with it, the
more adorable my POKéMON becomes.
GINA: Okay, let's battle with our
POKéMON!
GINA: Losing upsets me!
GINA: @
 is strong!
We have to train lots more!
GINA: Oh? Only one POKéMON?
Then, we don't battle with you.
If there's only one POKéMON, it will
be lonesome. That's not nice.
MIA: We are twins, so we battle
POKéMON together.
MIA: We battled together, but we
both lost...
MIA: We will train our POKéMON more
and be strong like you.
MIA: You want to battle with us?
It's a big no-no if you don't have two
POKéMON with you.=We're too strong for you!
Why keep it a secret?
I'm the WATER POKéMON expert!
Huh?
You don't know me?
I thought I wasn't too bad, if I may
say so, but I guess not... Bleah...
I got too into fishing.
I forgot I had to raise my POKéMON...
Leaving footprints in the sand is
so fun!
Waah! I got sand in my runners!
They're all gritty!
I want to leave my footprints in the
sand everywhere, but they disappear=quickly...
Should I...
Or shouldn't I?
Okay, sure, I will battle!
I shouldn't have battled...
If you're faced with a decision and
you let someone else choose for you,=you will regret it, however things=turn out.
Come on, battle with me!
Ohh...
I thought I could win...
I made the decision to battle, so I
can accept this loss in grace.
I am still upset about losing!
Oh, sure, I'll accept your challenge.
I have a lot of money.
Why couldn't I win?
There are some things money can't buy.
That's POKéMON...
After I lost to you, I learned a bunch
of things about POKéMON.
I lost again?
Why couldn't I win?
I'm fabulously wealthy, but I can't
seem to win at POKéMON...
It's so deep, the world of POKéMON...
We must have been fated to meet.
May I ask you for a battle?
Oh, my!
"Hello"2 is the beginning of "good-bye."2
I hope we meet again.
Hello, we meet again.
May I ask you for a battle?
Oh, my...
I did the best that I could...
"Hello"2 is the beginning of "good-bye."2
I hope we meet again.
There's supposed to be a mystical
rock around here.=Do you know anything about it?
I was thinking too much about that
rock, while my POKéMON remained weak...
I can spend hours and hours staring
at a nice rock without growing bored.
Whew! I was worried that a kid was
drowning when I saw you.
You seem to be okay, so what do you
say to a battle?
Glub... Glub...
If you are drowning, the signal is to
wave one arm toward the beach.
Swimming the deep blue sea...
It feels the greatest!
I lost...
Now I'm feeling blue...
Why is the sea blue?
I learned about that at the MUSEUM in
SLATEPORT, but I forgot.
My body feels lighter in the water.
It's as if I've gotten slimmer!
I'm floating...
Your body weight is reduced to just
one tenth in the water.
That would make me...
Whoops! I'm not telling you my weight!
The blue, blue sky...
The vast sea...=It's so peaceful...
I lost while I was lounging!
I want to be told I'm relaxing to be
with. Giggle.
Which do you prefer, fishing in the
sea or a stream?
Like in deep-sea fishing, I lost
spectacularly!
Fishing is the greatest whether it's
in the sea or a stream.=You agree with me, right?
I caught a bunch of POKéMON fishing.
I'll show you an impressive battle!
I lost again spectacularly!
Win or lose, POKéMON are the greatest!
You agree with me, right?
What do people do if they need to go
to a washroom?
What if my ROD hooks a big one while
I'm in the washroom? I just can't go...
I lost because I'm trying to not go
to the washroom...
Oh, no! I've got this feeling I'll hook
a big one!
Hahahah! I'm a lousy runner, but in
the water you can't catch me!
I give up!
I wouldn't lose in a swim race...
The sea is my backyard. I'm not going
to take it easy because you're a kid!
Did you take it easy on me by any
chance?
Drifting along with the waves...
I love it! Why don't you give it a try?
Yawn...
I must have drifted off to sleep while
I was drifting in the waves.
Ahaha, I lost...
I'll take a snooze, I think...
Floating and being rocked by the
waves - it's like sleeping in a plush,=comfy bed.
The sea is like my backyard.
Let's battle!
I lost on my home field...
I'm in shock!
I swim the seas with a heart full of
dreams...
It's a song!
Anyways, I'm swimming some more.
Swimming in the big, wide sea, my
POKéMON has grown stronger!
What a shock!
My POKéMON has gotten stronger, but
I stayed weak as a TRAINER!
What you learn in battle makes you a
stronger TRAINER.=The waves taught me that.
Do you know a little town called
DEWFORD?
I hate this!
A weird saying is getting really
trendy at DEWFORD HALL.
Did you want to battle me?
Sure, I'll go with you!
I wasn't good enough for you.
I think you're going to keep getting
better. I'll go for it, too!
LISA: We challenge you as a sister
and brother!
LISA: Awesome.
You're in a different class of tough.
LISA: Do you have any friends who
would go to the beach with you?
LISA: If you want to battle with us,
bring more POKéMON.
RAY: We always battle POKéMON, me
and my sister.
I always lose, but we can beat you
2-on-2!
RAY: Wowee, you're at a higher level
than us!
RAY: My sister gave me my POKéMON.
I raised it, and now it's my important=partner!
RAY: If you want to battle us, go
bring some more POKéMON!
My dream is to swim the world's seven
seas!
I won't be able to swim the seven seas
like this...
Playing with marine POKéMON is one of
the pleasures of swimming!
Ahoy, there! Are you going out to the
ABANDONED SHIP, too?
I'm sinking!
Glub... Glub...
Some people even go inside that
ABANDONED SHIP.
My liar of a boyfriend told me that
I look great in a bikini...
Oh, boo!
Even if it's a lie, I love being told
I look great...=We girls are so complex...
I love the sea!
I forget all my worries when I swim!
When I lose a battle, I get all
stressed out!
Work off your stress by swimming!
It's so healthy!
Hiyah! Look at my chiseled abs!
This is what you call "cut"2!
Aiyah!
Flubbed out!
Hiyah!
My sculpted abs have nothing to do
with POKéMON battles!
Are you properly protected against
the sun?
Ouch, ouch, ouch!
Cheeks are the most prone to burning!
I've laid anchor in ports around the
world, but SLATEPORT's the best.
You're the best!
In the best port was the best
TRAINER...
Urrrrppp...
Battle? With me?
Urp... Ooooooohhhhhh...
Urrrrpppp...
I'm usually stronger than this!
I'm just seasick as a dog!
I'm a SAILOR, but...
I'm thirsty... I could go for a SODA POP
at the SEASHORE HOUSE...
Groan...
I'm getting famished... My inner tube
looks like a giant doughnut...
I'm hungry, but I've got enough pep in
me for a battle!
I lost...
It's because I'm hungry...
When you eat on a beach, everything
seems to taste a little better.
Doesn't a beach umbrella look like
a giant flower?
Mommy!
If you look at the beach from the sky,
it looks like a big flower garden!
I'm not losing to you again!
That's why I have my inner tube!
Mommy!
If I have an inner tube, me and my
POKéMON's cuteness goes way up!
I can't swim without my inner tube,
but I won't lose at POKéMON!
Did I lose because I have an inner
tube?
My inner tube is a fashion item.
I can't be seen without it.
Hi, big TRAINER.
Will you battle with me?
Oh, you're strong.
How did you get to be so strong?
Wahahah! This dude's going to catch
himself a big one!
This dude just lost one...
This dude thinks you're a big one.
No, you're a big-one-to-be!
PAUL: Well, this is a mood-breaker.
I wish you wouldn't disturb our
precious time together.
PAUL: Well, I give up.
PAUL: Well, don't tell anyone that
we're here.=This is just our private world of two!
PAUL: We're totally, deeply in love.
That's why we make our POKéMON battle=together.
MEL: We're, like, totally in love.
Our romance is heating up all of HOENN!
MEL: We lost, and it's my fault!
PAUL will hate me!
MEL: Um, PAUL, are you angry with me?
Please don't be angry.
MEL: We're, like, deeply and truly in love.
That's why we make our POKéMON=battle together.
Whoa! Watch it!
I guess you're not used to BIKE racing.
Whoa!
My brakes failed!
Flat tires and brake problems can
cause serious injury!=Inspect your BIKE for problems!
Yo, you!
Can you keep up with my speed?
Crash and burn!
Speed alone won't let me win at POKéMON.
I need to reconsider this...
Don't panic if your BIKE's going fast!
I shouldn't panic during POKéMON
battles...
There's no need to panic or stress.
Take it easy. There's plenty of time.
Aren't you going a little too fast?
Take it easy and let's battle.
I didn't panic, but I still lost...
There's no need to panic or stress.
Take it easy. There's plenty of time.
The triathlon is hard in the extreme.
You have to complete the three events
of swimming, cycling, and running.
POKéMON battles are hard, too!
I'm exhausted, so I need a break.
It's important to get proper rest.
Isn't it neat to hold a battle while
cycling?
Wow...
How could you be so strong?
Were you going after a record?
I'm sorry if I held you up!
I've been riding without stopping.
My thighs are like rocks!
I'm worried about muscle cramps...
Oh, you have some GYM BADGES?
No wonder you're so strong!
I have foreseen your intentions!
I cannot possibly lose!
I failed to prophesize my own demise!
I see your future...
Hmm...
I see a shining light...
Ahahahaha!
I'll dazzle you with my wonders!
I wondrously lost!
You managed to win only because it was
a wonder! Yes, a wonder!=Don't think you can win all the time!
Could I see your POKéMON?
Just one look, please?
I wanted to complete my
collection...
When I see a POKéMON that I don't know,
my passion as a collector is ignited!
Hi, have you caught any new POKéMON?
Could I see your POKéMON?
Just one look, please?
Your POKéMON...
I envy you.
Oh, I long to make all rare POKéMON
mine!
Hey!
Don't sneak up behind me like that!
I lost!
Drat!
Fishing is all about concentration.
You have to focus on the floater.
Ahahaha! I would go anywhere to show
off my delightful POKéMON.
Oh, dear, this won't do.
Perhaps I should groom my POKéMON for
CONTESTS rather than battles.
Ahahahaha! I would be happy to show
off my POKéMON as often as you like!
Oh, dear, this won't do.
CONTESTS are delightful, but I like
to battle, too.
I found some cool POKéMON in the grass
around here!
Being cool isn't enough to win...
It's hard to battle with POKéMON you
just caught.
Oh, hey! Those GO-GOGGLES suit you.
But I think they look better on me.
Let's decide who they look better on
with a battle!
I couldn't see what was happening at my
sides because of the GO-GOGGLES.
The GO-GOGGLES make it possible to
get through sandstorms.=That makes me happy!
I'm having a picnic in the desert.
You can always find a TRAINER, so
I can enjoy a battle here, too!
Ohhh! You're mean!
When you're battling in a sandstorm,
watch out for your POKéMON's HP.
It can faint if you don't keep an eye
on it!
Wearing these GO-GOGGLES makes me
feel like a superhero.=Right now, nobody can beat me!
I can't win on spirit alone...
I'm going to be a real hero one day.
I'm going to work harder to make me=and my POKéMON stronger.
I heard there are fossils to be found
in the desert. Where could they be?
I came up short...
If they can find fossils in the desert,
it must have been a sea before.
For thirty years I have searched for
ancient ruins!=I am to be challenged?
While I have searched for ruins, I've
not searched for strong POKéMON.
For thirty years I have searched for
ancient ruins!
No, wait, was that forty years?
Which was it now?
For thirty years I have searched for
ancient ruins!
No, wait, was that forty years?
Anyway, am I to be challenged?
I've found no ruins, nor have I found
any strong POKéMON...
For thirty years I have searched for
ancient ruins!
No, wait, was that forty years I've
searched?
Hmm... It could even be fifty...
How long have I been at this?
I'm full of pep!
And my POKéMON is peppy, too!
My POKéMON lost its pep...
When I see a TRAINER with a lot of pep,
I can't help looking.
I don't know where you're going, but
would you like to battle?
Oh, you're disgustingly good!
I'm thinking that I should go to
MT. CHIMNEY, but the view around=here is very nice, too.
To train myself, I challenge all
whom I meet!
Uncle! I give up!
All I can do is keep training until
I can defeat strong TRAINERS such=as yourself.
Show me how much you've toughened
your POKéMON.
I see, you've toughened them
considerably.
POKéMON and TRAINERS learn much
through battling.
What's important is to never give up
even if you lose.
We're training here to elevate our
game to the next level.=Stay and train with us!
Ooh, you're decent!
Since you're that strong, you should
aim for the POKéMON LEAGUE.
Oh, your POKéMON look like serious
actors.=I have to ask you for an engagement.
They didn't just look strong, they
are strong!
I thought I was raising my POKéMON
diligently, but, oh no, there is still=much to be done.
You can make POKéMON stronger or
weaker depending on the moves you=teach them.
What kinds of moves do your POKéMON
know?
You've taught them good moves!
Maybe I should have stopped my
POKéMON from evolving until they=learned better moves...
Hahahaha!
How about we have a battle?=You and me!=Hahahaha!
I lost!
Hahahaha!
Hahahahaha! Something flew up my nose!
Hahahaha-hatchoo!
My legs are solid from pounding up
and down the mountains.
They're not going to buckle easily,
friend!
Ouch! My legs cramped up!
Try hiking, and I mean really
pounding, on these mountain trails=with a heavy pack weighing dozens of=pounds.
That, my friend, will get your body
into serious shape.
I've been keeping fit by hiking.
Power, I have in spades!
I got trumped in power?
I hear there are some seriously tough
TRAINERS on top of MT. CHIMNEY.
I intend to get up there and give them
a challenge!
I'm strong.
I won't cry if I lose.
Waaaah!
I'm not crying because I miss my mommy!
Snivel...
When you're out on a picnic, why, you
simply have to sing!=Come on, sing with me!
Oh, you're so strong!
It doesn't matter if you're good or bad
at singing or POKéMON.
If you have the most fun, you win!
Can you guess why it's so cool
around here?
Peeuuw!
That stinks!
The volcanic ash blocks the sun, so it
doesn't get very warm.
That's good for me - I can't stand heat!
The volcano's eruption is proof that
the earth is alive.
You're some kind of strong!
Ouch! Owww! I can't see!
I got ashes in my eyelashes!
Get it? Ashes and eyelashes?
Okay, that was bad, sorry...
I use this parasol to ward off this
filthy, yucky volcanic ash from my=dear NUMEL.
Huff, huff...
I am exhausted...
You're very good at this.
I must say I'm impressed!
Oh, hello, hasn't it been a while?
May I invite you to battle?
Oh, how super!
You've remained very good at this.
I must say I'm impressed!
From out of the ashes I leap! Hiyah!
I challenge thee!
With honor I admit defeat!
I must refine the art of concealment.
I bid thee farewell.
From out of the ashes I leap! Hiyah!
I challenge thee!
With honor I admit defeat!
My flawless concealment was let down
by my immature battle skills...
I bid thee farewell.
Thanks for finding me!
But we still have to battle!
I'll use my ninjutsu on you...
"VOLCANIC ASH SWIRL CLOAK"2!
...What? It's already over?
You know what's crummy about hiding?
It's lonely if no one comes along.
TORI: Both of us, we collect ashes.
We battle POKéMON, too.
TORI: We lost... It's boring, so I'm going
to get some more ashes.
TORI: How much ash do we have?
Enough for a WHITE FLUTE, I hope.
TORI: We want to battle 2-on-2.
If we didn't, we would lose!
TIA: Both of us, we collect ashes.
We battle POKéMON, too.
TIA: We couldn't win... It's boring,
so I'm getting some more ashes.
TIA: We have a lot of ashes!
I think enough for a WHITE FLUTE!
TIA: We want to battle 2-on-2.
If we don't, we won't win!
Yodelayhihoo!
... ...
You're supposed to shout
"yodelayhihoo"2 since it doesn't=echo here!
Yodelayhihoo!
When I was a wee tyke, I believed there
was someone copying me and shouting=back, "Yodelayhihoo."2
If you're not prepared, you shouldn't
be up in the mountains!
The mountains are unforgiving...
In the winter, mountains turn deadly
with blizzards and avalanches.
Camping's fun! You can fish, roast
marshmallows, and tell spooky stories!
But the best of all are the POKéMON
battles!
Way too strong!
I think it's great that I can go
camping with my POKéMON.
I need to exercise after a meal.
Let's have a match!
Oh, no!
I just had a tasty meal.
I'm getting drowsy...
Ufufufufufu...
Want to battle against my POKéMON?
M-My POKéMON...
A big body that's all lumpy and hard,
enormous horns, and vicious fangs...
Ufufufufu...
I wish I had a POKéMON like that...
Ufufufufufu...
Come on, battle my POKéMON...
I feel so lucky getting to see your
POKéMON...
Ufufufufufu...
When I see POKéMON battling, I get all
shivery and shaky...
If you're lighting a campfire, make
sure you have water handy.
Thanks for dousing my fire!
You really do have to be careful with
any sort of fire in a forest.
Don't ever underestimate the power
of fire.
Have you learned to keep water handy
for campfires?
I got hosed down before I could flare
up, I guess.
You really do have to be careful with
any sort of fire in a forest.
Don't ever underestimate the power
of fire.
If we were fishing, you wouldn't stand
a chance against me.=So, bring on your POKéMON!
If we were fishing, I would've won...
I think I'll try my luck at landing
a big one at METEOR FALLS.
There has to be something in there.
I just know it.
I like to fish. But I also like to
battle!
If anyone challenges me, I'm there,
even if I'm fishing.
I like to battle, but that doesn't
mean I'm good at it...
This time I'll do it!
I always think that, so I can't walk
away from fishing or POKéMON.
TYRA: Well, sure.
I'm in the mood for it.=I'll teach you a little about POKéMON.
TYRA: What an amazing battle style!
TYRA: I was teaching my junior IVY
about POKéMON.
TYRA: Giggle...
If you want to battle with us, just one=POKéMON isn't enough!
IVY: Who taught you about POKéMON?
IVY: What an amazing battle style!
IVY: I started training POKéMON
because TYRA, my student mentor,=taught me!
IVY: Do you only have one POKéMON?
I think it must feel lonesome.
Hm...
You seem rather capable...=Let me keep you company!
You're much stronger than
I'd imagined!
There is no such thing as a born genius.
It all depends on effort!=That is what I believe...
Hm... As always, your agility speaks
for itself.=Come, keep me company!
As strong as ever!
All it takes is effort!
I lost because I haven't put in enough
effort!
You!
My MACHOP!
Demand a battle!
Ouch, ouch, ouch!
My MACHOP crew!
So long as they seek power, I will
grow strong with them!
My strongest skill is busting bricks
with my forehead!
Ugwaaaah!
My head is busted!
I've been teaching my POKéMON karate.
It looks like they'll get a lot better
than me. I'm excited about that.
After you beat me, we trained hard to
improve our skills.=Come on, give us a rematch!
Ugwaaah!
We lost again!
My POKéMON will grow stronger!
I'll redouble my training!
This beach is my secret training spot!
Don't come butting in!
I haven't trained enough!
The sand acts as a cushion to reduce
impact and prevent injury.=This is the perfect place to train.
Okay, let's get this battle on!
I can battle but my POKéMON...
Even when I lose, I still get some
enjoyment out of it.=It must be that I love POKéMON.
I have a rare POKéMON!
Would you like me to show you?
You...
You want my POKéMON, don't you?
I have this rare POKéMON.
It's enough to keep me satisfied.
I have a rare POKéMON!
Would you like me to show you?
You...
You want my POKéMON, don't you?
I have this rare POKéMON.
It's enough to keep me satisfied.
If the tunnel doesn't go through, then
I'll just go over the top.
Gasp... Gasp...
Losing made me tired...
It's no big deal if there's no tunnel.
To a HIKER, mountains are roads!
My POKéMON rule!
Check them out!
Ouch! A scrape!
I have to put on a bandage!
Bandages are signs of toughness!
I've got another one!
My BUG POKéMON are tough!
Let's battle!
I lost!
I thought I had you!
BUG POKéMON evolve quickly.
So they get strong quickly, too.
Let me teach you how strong my
adorable POKéMON is!
You're a notch above me...
POKéMON that possess cuteness and
power, that's ideal, I think.
We learn all sorts of things at the
TRAINER'S SCHOOL.
I want to test things out for real!
I slacked off in school...
That's why I lost.
I'll have to redo some courses at the
TRAINER'S SCHOOL.=If I don't, ROXANNE will be steamed.
I've been studying seriously at the
TRAINER'S SCHOOL.=I won't lose like I did last time.
Hunh?
I studied diligently.
I'll have to redo some courses at the
TRAINER'S SCHOOL.=If I don't, ROXANNE will be steamed.
I study at school, and I study on the
way home, too!
I'm in shock - I lost?
Awww, I'll never become an elegant
TRAINER like ROXANNE this way!
I studied a whole lot since I saw you.
You must see my achievements!
I'm in shock. I lost again?
You've beaten ROXANNE?
I can't beat you, then. Not yet.
Listen, could I get you to battle the
POKéMON I'm raising?
You've raised yours superbly...
POKéMON isn't all about power.
Polishing a unique aspect of one's
character is another way of enjoying=POKéMON.
The POKéMON I've been raising are
looking good, just like before.
You know how to raise them properly.
You might have DAY CARE skills...
Your POKéMON are growing good!
You should enter them in CONTESTS.
Please, allow me to evaluate if you
have raised your POKéMON properly.
Yes, they are growing properly.
If you feed
S to POKéMON, the
unique aspects of their character=will be enhanced.
Allow me to reevaluate if you have
raised your POKéMON properly.
They are growing admirably.
POKéMON seem to like different kinds
of
S, depending on their nature.
I'm in the middle of a triathlon, but,
whatever, let's have a battle!
I ran out of energy!
I may have blown it...
I might have dropped to last during
that battle...
I'm smack in the middle of a triathlon,
but I'm comfortably ahead.=Let's make this a quick battle!
I ran out of energy again!
I was tops in swimming and cycling, but
I'm not quite that confident with=POKéMON yet.
I do my triathlon training with POKéMON,
so I'm pretty confident about my speed.
I need to get more practices in,
I guess.
Training is meaningful only if you
keep it up regularly.
Okay! I'll resume my training!
Tomorrow!
Are you keeping up with your training?
I sure am!=Let me show you the evidence!
I need to get more practices in,
I guess.
I'll resume training tomorrow.
Let's battle again sometime!
Once a BUG CATCHER!
And now a BUG MANIAC!
But my love for POKéMON remains
unchanged!
My ineptitude also remains
unchanged...
All I did was follow my heart, and now
they call me a BUG MANIAC...
Still, I am an expert on BUG POKéMON,
so it's only natural that they call me=a BUG MANIAC.
ANNA: I'm with my pretty junior student
partner. I have to do good!
ANNA: I'm with my pretty junior student
partner! Let me win!
ANNA: Your POKéMON have some good
combinations.
I'd say you're second only to us!
ANNA: If you want to battle us, bring
two POKéMON with you.
MEG: I'm going to tag up with my super
senior student partner and beat you!
MEG: Oh, no!
I'm sorry, ANNA! I let you down...
MEG: I dragged ANNA down...
If I didn't, she would have won!
MEG: Do you only have one POKéMON?
We can't battle with you, then.
We want to have a 2-on-2 battle.
ANNA: I can't keep losing in front of
my junior partner, right?
ANNA: I couldn't get into the groove.
ANNA: Your POKéMON have some good
combinations.
I'd say you're second only to us!
ANNA: If you want to battle us, bring
two POKéMON with you.
MEG: I'm going to tag up with my
senior partner and win this time!
MEG: Too strong!
MEG: I battled together with my
senior partner, but we lost...
That's so discouraging...
MEG: Do you only have one POKéMON?
We can't battle with you, then.
We want to have a 2-on-2 battle.
The aroma of flowers has a magical
power. It cleanses us body and soul.
Oh, dear me.
I seem to have lost.
Flowers, POKéMON...
I love whatever smells nice.
Stinky things...
I'll pass.
Were you drawn here by the sweet
aroma?
The power of aroma...
It didn't seem to do much.
If you use a sweet aroma properly,
POKéMON will be attracted by it.
BIRD POKéMON that FLY elegantly in
the sky... They're the best!
Urgh... I crashed...
You've got great POKéMON.
I'll have to train mine better.
Take flight!
My BIRD POKéMON!
They did take flight...
If they'd get stronger, they'd be able
to fly more freely...
I'm a FISHERMAN, but also a TRAINER.
I'm raising the POKéMON I caught.
I thought I was doing okay in my
training...
I couldn't win by training POKéMON
while I fished...
Was I doing things in half measures?
For FISHERMEN, equipment is the key.
But for TRAINERS, the key ingredients
are POKéMON and heart, of course!
I was beaten in heart?
Come to think of it, fishing is a battle
between a FISHERMAN and a POKéMON.
Let my melody rock your soul!
La-lalala...
An electric guitar doesn't always
have to be noisy...
It can be strummed to squeeze out
this heart-stirring melody...
A melody from my POKéMON and me...
Let us deliver it to your soul.
La-lalala...
When I play, my emotions should reach
you through my electric guitar...
We're the MIMIC CIRCLE!
We MIMIC what you do!
Whoopsie!
I lost!
What's so good about mimicry?
Fufufu...
You'll never understand...
So, we finally meet!
My BUG POKéMON will keep you company!
I wish we'd never met...
I want to MIMIC you some more.
Can you hurry up and move?
If you step forward, we step forward.
If you turn right, we turn, too...
But if you win, I lose...
I can't MIMIC you winning the match.
That's just impossible...=It's burning me up...
Yep, you've finally caught me!
Or were you trying to avoid me?
Whoop, that was a great match!
We're the MIMIC CIRCLE!
I hope you enjoyed our performance.
You don't know who I am, do you?
But, I also don't know you.
So, we'll battle!
You're pretty strong!
Until you go away somewhere, we'll
keep on mimicking your every move.
The MIMIC CIRCLE was formed by people
who like to MIMIC.
A battle starts the instant we meet!
I surrender!
Won't you join our MIMIC CIRCLE?
Who has the knowledge and the
technique for survival?
POKéMON RANGERS, that's who!
I didn't have enough POKéMON
know-how...
To break away from civilization and
awaken the wild spirit within!
That's our vision.
I'm going to regain my wild spirit by
being together with POKéMON.
You've remained strong!
Believe in your POKéMON.
Believe in yourself.
The road will reveal itself to you.
Oh? Look at you.
For someone on an adventure, you're
traveling awfully light.
Accidents happen when you're not
prepared!
You're traveling light but you have
everything you need.
You're on top of things mentally and
physically, too.
How's your journey with POKéMON
going?
I'm still missing something...
In the same way that you, as a TRAINER,
rely on your POKéMON, your POKéMON=rely on you.
The vast sky holds untold promise!
Nothing can compare to the sheer
exhilaration of flight!
Down and out!
My BIRD POKéMON made my dreams of
flying come true!
I'll show you the true potential of me
and my BIRD POKéMON!
We lacked potential...
Ever since I was a little kid, I always
admired BIRD POKéMON...
To lurk in shadows, and live in
darkness... That is my destiny.
I emerge to challenge you!
I admit defeat!
Those defeated in battle withdraw
quietly back into the shadows.=That, too, is destiny...
If you're not on your guard, you're in
for some pain!
You're surprisingly good!
My surprise attack ended in
failure...
To hide a tree, use a forest!
I bow to your superiority.
To hide a tree, use a forest!
To hide a POKéMON, use a POKéMON!
There is no deep, hidden meaning
to that.
You spoke to me...
So you want to challenge me!
Sure! I'll try out the POKéMON I caught
while SURFING!
I don't have a clue about what it
takes to win.
Go for a SURF on my POKéMON...
Then fish off its back...
It's an indescribably luxuriant moment!
Do you have any moves that can strike
a flying POKéMON?
You soared above me!
The move FLY is convenient, don't
you think?
While the POKéMON is flying, almost
no moves can strike it.
My POKéMON is strong!
How about yours?
Your POKéMON were stronger...
A POKéMON that grows steadily is one
you can count on.
A POKéMON that grows steadily is one
you can count on.
Your POKéMON are seriously strong.
My POKéMON are growing stronger.
I have to grow stronger, too.
I'll check your POKéMON and see if
they're fit for the outdoors.
With POKéMON that strong, you're in
no danger of needing rescue!
To travel wherever your heart desires
with POKéMON...=That's the joy of being a TRAINER.
How's your physical fitness?
If you're not fit, you could have a=rough time in critical situations.
I'm totally fit, but...
Fitness training is in my routine.
I always run with my POKéMON.
... ... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ... ...=Want to battle?
... ... ... ... ... ...
I lost...
... ... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ... ...=I'll try harder...
... ... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ... ...=Want to battle again?
... ... ... ... ... ...
I lost again...
... ... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ... ...=I'll try harder...=For my precious BUG POKéMON...
POKéMON have many special abilities.
If you want to become a first-class=TRAINER, learn about them.
You're obviously thinking.
The special abilities of POKéMON
will make battle styles change.
Who might you be?
Are you perhaps searching for ancient
ruins that are rumored to possibly=exist according to legend?
What a disgraceful setback...
That giant rock... I would like to
believe it may indeed contain ancient=ruins. But I see no entrance.
Why am I carrying this parasol?
I'll tell you if you can win against me.
A parasol can't ward off POKéMON
attacks...
I don't think strong sunlight is good
for my POKéMON.=So I shield them with my parasol.
Me, POKéMON, and my parasol...
If any one of them is missing, the
picture of beauty will be ruined.
You've completely ruined my beauty...
A parasol wouldn't suit you at all.
Why, something like this would only
get in your way.
I will adopt the movements of POKéMON
and create new ninja techniques.
The creation of new ninja techniques
is but a distant dream...
Perhaps I ought to apprentice under
a ninja sensei.
We ninja conceal ourselves under our
camouflage cloaks.=I bet you didn't know where I was!
I lost!
I should camouflage my shame!
Our camouflage cloaks are all
handmade.
Will you play with my delightfully
pretty POKéMON?
This isn't what I meant!
I'm going to a CONTEST in LILYCOVE.
My POKéMON should have no problem
sweeping the MASTER CLASS.
With my POKéMON, I have traveled the
world's four corners.
You might say I have some confidence
in my abilities.
Ah, well played.
I would like to circle the globe once
again with my POKéMON.
With my POKéMON, I have traveled the
world's four corners.
You might say I have some confidence
in my abilities.
Ah, well played.
Your POKéMON and you...
Your prowess together will be
considered strong, even overseas.
There are powers beyond our
understanding in the world...
I have lost...
MT. PYRE...
There is a mysterious power=at work there...
KATE: Together, we're fearless!
We'll demonstrate how tough we are!
KATE: I blew it in front of my junior
student partner...
KATE: When someone's relying on me,
I get this urge to look cool in front=of them...
KATE: If you've only got one POKéMON,
we can't battle with you.
That would be bullying.
JOY: Together, we're fearless!
We'll demonstrate how tough we are!
JOY: Please forgive me, KATE!
JOY: Ehehe, I'll have to train with KATE,
my senior student partner, again.
JOY: You need at least two POKéMON
if you're going to challenge us!
Stop! Have a good look at my precious
POKéMON!
Oh, how dare you!
Don't take it so seriously!
Maybe I'll go catch more POKéMON at
the SAFARI.
My precious POKéMON grew!
Have a good look!
Oh, how dare you!
You still won't take it easy!
Maybe I'll go catch more POKéMON at
the SAFARI.
Want to determine how strong you are?
I'll be the test!
You passed with flying colors!
To best even me...
Your strength is marvelous!
You seem to have a big collection
of GYM BADGES.
Let me see if you're actually worthy of
those BADGES!
Oh, you're worthy, all right!
You did your BADGES proud in that
match!
They say that good times are filled
with good aromas.
Oh...
I smell the bitter scent of misery...
The BERRY MASTER's garden is filled
with uplifting fragrances.
Being a psychic is about willpower.
I've willed myself not to lose to
anyone. That makes me strong!
I feel sad...
Being a psychic is about willpower.
I thought I wouldn't lose to you...
I've convinced myself that I won't
lose anymore. That makes me strong!
I feel sad...
I should train at MT. PYRE...
I'll never beat you this way...
Don't be too happy if your POKéMON
develop psychic powers.
You need to refine those powers to
make them really useful.
Astounding!
We all have psychic powers.
We've just forgotten how to use them.
Have you awoken the psychic powers
within you?
Astounding!
Your power with POKéMON...
That could be a psychic power, too.
MIU: Hello, TRAINER. I hope your
POKéMON won't cry when they lose.
MIU: Uh-oh, we lost.
MIU: TRAINER, your POKéMON are
strong because you are friends.
MIU: It's no fun to battle if you
don't have two POKéMON.
YUKI: Okay!
We're beating the TRAINER's POKéMON!
YUKI: Uh-oh, we lost.
YUKI: Why are you so strong?
We've never lost before.
YUKI: It's no fun to battle if you
don't have two POKéMON.
MT. PYRE...
Where the spirits of POKéMON sleep...=Will your POKéMON sleep?
Overflowing with vitality...
MT. PYRE...
Where the spirits of POKéMON sleep...
It must overflow with a power that
soothes spirits...
Hey, are you lost at sea?
If you can beat my POKéMON, I can
serve as your pilot.
I lost my bearings in battle!
Many people lose their bearings at sea.
If you're that sort, you should refer
to the POKéNAV's MAP.
Hm! You're riding a POKéMON instead
of swimming yourself...
I am envious!
Oh!
I can't...
I'm getting chilled...
I've been in the water too long...
I wish I could ride a POKéMON like you...
If you just float in the sea like
this, POKéMON come around to play.
Oh...
Lost at sea...
While swimming, I noticed that some
POKéMON attack, and some just watch.
I guess POKéMON have personalities
of their own.
If you just float in the sea like this,
TRAINERS challenge you!
That's strange...
I lost again...
This has nothing to do with anything,
but maybe I'll visit the TRICK HOUSE.
I'm growing bored of swimming...
How about a battle?
I had no idea that you were
this strong!
All the effort you put in must have
made you this strong.
Fufufufu... I dive deep underwater
to go deep under cover.=Plumbing the depths is where I excel!
Glub, glub, glub...
I'm sinking...
I have it on good authority that
there's a DIVE spot around here.
It gives me the urge to go deep
again...
RITA: Sigh...
Here I am in the sea, but who's with me?
My little brother!
Let's battle so I won't have to dwell
on that!
RITA: SAM! It's your fault we lost!
You're in for it later!
RITA: Sigh...
If only it wasn't my little brother
next to me, but a nice boyfriend...
RITA: You're planning to battle us?
Not unless you have more POKéMON.
SAM: My big sister is tough at POKéMON!
Don't cry when you lose!
SAM: Uh-oh...
My big sister will chew me out...
SAM: My big sister is really scary
when she gets angry.
That's why she doesn't have a
boyfriend.
SAM: Did you want to battle us?
Bring some more POKéMON, then.
RITA: Sigh...
Here I am in the sea, but who's with me?
My little brother!
Oh, hi, it's been a while. Let's battle
so I won't have to dwell on things!
RITA: SAM!
It's your fault we lost again!
We're having a training session later!
RITA: Sigh...
If I had a nice boyfriend, we'd beat
anyone with lovely combinations...
RITA: You're planning to battle us?
Not unless you have more POKéMON.
SAM: If we lose, I'll catch heck.
I'm going to go totally all out!
SAM: Uh-oh...
My big sister will chew me out again.
SAM: My big sister is really scary
when she gets angry.
She's going to make me train really
hard with POKéMON later...
SAM: Did you want to battle us?
Bring some more POKéMON, then.
I heard you approaching, so I hung
around for you!
I beg for peace!
Sound travels faster in water than
it does through air.
Hey, there!
Check out my sweet POKéMON!
I floundered...
I was blown away by HORSEA's charm,
so I started swimming, too.
I'm tired of swimming.
Are you up for a battle with me?
You're too much!
Whew...
Which way is it to MOSSDEEP CITY?
How would you like to take on the
WATER-type POKéMON I raised?
I lost...
Your power... You're the real deal.
I'm amazed!
Ahoy! I'm a buff, tough SAILOR!
I've braved the world's seas!
Gwrroooar!
I couldn't win!
The tide ebbs and flows inside the
SHOAL CAVE.
By the way, it's about six hours from
high tide to low tide. Did you know?
It's high time I get my payback
from you! Come on, we're battling!
I couldn't win!
I flat out couldn't win!
The SHOAL CAVE...
There are places you can and can't
get to depending on the rise and fall=of the tide.
By the way, it's about six hours from
high tide to low tide. Don't forget!
KIM: A funny old man lives in the
SHOAL CAVE. Someone told me.=Are you going to see him, too?
KIM: I thought we would win.
KIM: A funny old man lives in the
SHOAL CAVE, doesn't he?
Let's go see him, IRIS!
KIM: No, no, no! You need two POKéMON,
or it's just no good!
IRIS: KIM, can you tell me what we're
looking for out here?
IRIS: Oh, we came sort of close.
IRIS: KIM, are we really going into
the SHOAL CAVE?=We'll get all wet.
IRIS: Oh, we could never, ever do
anything like a 2-on-1 battle.
Swimming is a full-body workout!
You will get fit!
I admit it! You win!
Thanks to my daily swimming routine...
Look! Feast your eyes on this physique!
This towering white mountain of rock
is SOOTOPOLIS CITY.
I was done in?
I can't find the entrance to
SOOTOPOLIS. Where could it be?
Ufufufufu!
I'm a mermaid!
My fantasy burst as if it were a bubble!
Blub, blub, blub...
You thrashed me... I want to
disappear in a wave of despair...
Hello, kiddo!
Want a battle with me?
Oh, noooooh!
I love frolicking with POKéMON in
the sea like this!
I can see it in your face. You want
to challenge me.
Awawawawawa...
A well-played match leaves me feeling
refreshed and serene.
Do you have a rival whom you just
hate to lose against?
Arrrgh! I hate losing!
If you have a rival, don't you get the
feeling that you have to keep getting=better?
Through fishing, I have attained a
state of becalmed serenity...=Please, allow me to demonstrate...
Though I have lost, my heart remains
calm...
It matters not that I catch nothing.
The line remains in the water...
Whoops! Don't tell me I snagged
a SURFING POKéMON?
I can't keep up!
Your POKéMON look pretty strong.
They'd be a handful if I hooked them!
Well, hey! This is a match between a
POKéMON fan and a fishing buff!
No! My line's all tangled!
The party's over!
My fishing line's doing a dance!
The tangle tango! Hahaha, snarl!
What I learned at DEWFORD's POKéMON
GYM, I will put into practice here.
I was swamped!
BRAWLY, DEWFORD's GYM LEADER, used
to train with a guy named BRUNO in=KANTO, I've heard.
BIRD POKéMON have excellent vision.
They spot prey from great heights.
Whew... I give up.
There're lots of diving spots in the
sea around here.
You can spot them easily from the sky
because of their darker color.
EVER GRANDE CITY is still a long ways
away...
My first victory seems to be far
away, too...
My whole life has been about losing,
but I will never give up!
I'm still feeling good. I'll keep on
swimming to EVER GRANDE CITY.
I've yet to taste my first victory...
I'll eventually reach EVER GRANDE CITY
where I can eventually win...
You have to swim, cycle, and then run
a marathon in a triathlon.
It's a grueling race that consists
of three events.
A POKéMON battle is grueling, too...
I have to ride a BIKE next, but...
I'm about to throw in the towel...
A triathlon is long. But I guess the
road to become the POKéMON CHAMPION=is also a long and grueling one.
A POKéMON battle really is harsh
and unforgiving...
You should give serious thought to
challenges on VICTORY ROAD.
We've been working so hard to mount
a POKéMON LEAGUE challenge...
We can't afford to lose now!
Oh!
How could this happen?!
After all I've done to get here, I won't
give up after one setback.
There is no stronger TRAINER than I!
This can't be!
There probably is no stronger TRAINER
than you!
I want to visit EVER GRANDE, so I
caught myself a POKéMON that knows=the move WATERFALL to crest the falls.
I'm crestfallen!
Awww, phooey!
My POKéMON know WATERFALL, but
I don't have the SOOTOPOLIS GYM BADGE!
This is my first triathlon.
I'm all tense and nervous!
Wroooaaar!
I failed to win!
If I'm all tensed up, I won't be able to
give it my all.
I'm in the middle of a triathlon, but,
sure, why don't we battle?
I was sure I'd win!
Do you know what's the greatest thing
about triathlons?
Testing the limits of your own
strength and endurance against=Mother Nature!
Say hey, hey!
Let's get on with it!
Beat, I'm beaten.
That's it, done!
There's nothing for a loser.
Time for me to beat it home.
What's the hurry?
Let's take it slow and easy.
Oh, my.
I wanted to relax a little more...
Don't you hate making mistakes when
you're in a rush?
That's why I try to take things
slowly.
What a surprise! I didn't expect to
see a TRAINER out in the sea.
I think we should battle!
This kid's awfully tough...
Your eyes have that look of someone
who's experienced harsh challenges=and won. It suits you well!
In the deep blue sea,
my shattered blue heart finds=comfort among waves.
Like the vast blue sea,
the world of POKéMON spans=depths beyond belief.
The world's children dream
of one day becoming the=POKéMON CHAMPION.
The sea is teeming with POKéMON.
It's not easy swimming, I tell you.
POKéMON raised by TRAINERS are
seriously tough...
Gasp... Gasp... I'm wiped out...
The going's easy. It's the leaving
that's the hard part.
Will I have any energy left to make
the return trip?
The sea... The sea... The sea...
The sea as far as these eyes can see!=I'm sick and tired of the sea!
Bleah!
Bored I am by the sea, but swim I must.
I'm a born swimmer!
That's what I am.
Hi, sweetie, wait!
We should battle, you and I!
You're tough in spite of the way
you look!
Did you see a guy over there who whines
that he's bored of the sea?
That's all talk.
He's hopelessly in love with the sea!
Why do men love bathing suits so much?
They all ogle me!
I'm out of my depth!
Maybe it's not my bathing suit that
makes men look. It must be my beauty!
RELI: We'll work together as siblings
to take you on!
RELI: We couldn't win even though we
worked together...
RELI: The people of PACIFIDLOG are
together with the sea and POKéMON from=the time they are born.
RELI: You don't have two POKéMON?
We can't enjoy a battle, then.
IAN: I'm doing my best together with
my sis!
IAN: I did my best with my sis, but
we still couldn't win...
IAN: You know how PACIFIDLOG is
a floating town?
So, wherever there is the sea, that's
a part of PACIFIDLOG!
IAN: If you have two POKéMON, we'll
take you on!
I used to catch colds all the time as
a kid, but I became totally fit after=I started swimming.
I crave more power...
TRAINERS travel the fields and
mountains, so they must be fit, too.
I try not to swim where the currents
are too strong.
Oh, please, no!
If I get swept away, I'll lose all my
sense of place...
Win or lose, you'll never know until
you try!
Waah!
I sank in defeat!
I never battle when I know I'll win.
I like to battle at the razor's edge of=victory and defeat!
I contemplate POKéMON 24 hours a day.
How could you possibly beat me?
I lose.
I will concede defeat.
Urggh...
You're a POKéMON fanatic, aren't you?
You must contemplate POKéMON 24 hours
a day, don't you?
Did the currents carry you here, too?
This must have been fated. Let's battle!
Strong!
Too much so!
It's just my luck that a tough TRAINER
like you would drift here...=I must be cursed...
I've led a life of woe and misery...
I've been cast away, and this is where=I've drifted...
Another loss...
A life adrift...
I don't want it anymore!
Welcome!
I've been expecting you!
No! Please!
A strong child TRAINER...
That's so annoying!
I want to win like everyone else, but I
won't raise POKéMON like everyone else.
Darn it!
My way is still too slack!
It's way more fun to do things the way
I want than to be like everybody else.=I mean, that's obvious!
I came all the way out here with my
BIRD POKéMON.
You...
You're stunningly cool!
I'd like to go back to FORTREE, but I've
grown to like this place, too.
Even those POKéMON that can swim are
carried along by the rapid currents.
Aiyeeeeh!
I think POKéMON enjoy the fast-running
currents around these parts.
My LUVDISC are looking for a fun
match. Will you join us?
Oopsie!
There's a collector who's after the
SCALES of LUVDISC.
Okeydokey! That's enough rest, gang!
It's time for a match!
Tuckered out again...
My BIRD POKéMON get tired quickly after
a long flight...
You're a POKéMON TRAINER.
No need for words. We battle now.
... ... ... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ... ... ...
It was I who challenged you, and yet
I lost. I am deeply shamed...
The savage tide in this area serves to
make us stronger than ever.
I concede defeat.
We will return for more training at
METEOR FALLS.
If you'd like, you should go, too.
It will definitely toughen you up!
REPEL's effect wore off...

Would you like to exit the SAFARI ZONE
right now?
Ding-dong! Time's up!
Your SAFARI Game is over.
You've run out of SAFARI BALLS.
Your SAFARI Game is over.
Would you like to place a

 FEEDER?
The @
 you left
before is still here.
The @
 was placed
on the
 FEEDER.
Welcome to the SAFARI ZONE!
Here, you may witness many kinds of
POKéMON rarely seen in HOENN.
And, you'll see them in their wild,
untamed state in natural habitats.
What's more, we've thrown open the
gates to POKéMON TRAINERS.
You're encouraged to catch POKéMON
for keeps!
Come in and enjoy the SAFARI ZONE!
Welcome to the SAFARI ZONE!
Is it your first time here?
Come in and enjoy the SAFARI ZONE!
When you enter the SAFARI ZONE, you
start with 30 SAFARI BALLS for=catching POKéMON.
The SAFARI Game is over when you run
out of SAFARI BALLS, or when you've=walked 500 steps.
Come in and enjoy the SAFARI ZONE!
Welcome to the SAFARI ZONE!
All you can catch for just $500!
Would you like to play a SAFARI Game?
Okay.
Please play another time!
You don't have enough money.
Sorry.
That will be $500, please.
Here are your SAFARI BALLS.
LANDON received 30 SAFARI BALLS.
We'll let you know when your game
is over.
So, until then, enjoy yourself, please!
Off you go on your wild excursion!
Excuse me!
Your PC BOX is full.
Excuse me!
You seem to be without a
 CASE.
Your SAFARI Game will be much more
fruitful if you use
Please come back with a
 CASE.
You still have time left. Would you like
to exit the SAFARI ZONE now?
Please enjoy the rest of your wild
adventure!
Okay.
I'll take back your remaining SAFARI
BALLS.
Thank you for playing.
We hope to see you again.
Good luck!
If you need anything, don't hesitate
to tell me, please!
Did you know?
If you put a
 in that square box,
POKéMON gather around.
I want to keep going deeper, but I
forgot to bring a BIKE.
Something tells me that rare POKéMON
live in the outlying areas.
Sometimes, when I toss a
 at
POKéMON, it gets ignored.
Do POKéMON have likes and dislikes
about what they eat?
Gasp... Gasp...
I...made it out here...but...
I'm exhausted... I don't have the
energy to catch POKéMON...
I'm on a mission to find WATER POKéMON
you don't see in HOENN.
Do you have any idea where the lake is?
I'm going to catch a lot of rare POKéMON
here and trade them with my friends!
I put a
 on the
 FEEDER.
But it seems to have disappeared.
I guess POKéMON must have eaten it
without me noticing.
SAFARI ZONE TRAINER TIP!
Throw
S at wild POKéMON to make
them less likely to flee.
"Relieve your tired feet."2
REST HOUSE
I don't have any
S, but I caught
a good number of POKéMON.
You can improve your chances of making
a catch by getting closer to them=before throwing a SAFARI BALL.
If you use
S, wild POKéMON won't
be so quick to run away.
It's not much use to give
S to
POKéMON that don't flee easily.
If you put a
 on the FEEDER,
POKéMON are attracted to it.
I think POKéMON with the same sort of
nature are drawn by a certain

PROF. BIRCH: Ah, LANDON
Have you come to show me how your
POKéDEX is coming along?
Hm? Oh, you haven't caught enough
POKéMON to make it worthwhile.
Hmhm...
So, you've seen @
 POKéMON,
and you've caught @
 POKéMON...
You should go into grassy areas more
and look for POKéMON more carefully.
I guess you're getting the hang of it.
But, it gets harder from here.
Some POKéMON only appear in certain
areas. You'll need to be persistent.
Well, it could use more quantity, but
this is looking more like a POKéDEX now.
This is coming along pretty good.
Keep up the effort.
Are you using any RODS?
There are many POKéMON in the sea.
Instead of just catching POKéMON,
how about making them evolve, too?
This is going to be a fantastic POKéDEX.
That's the feeling I'm getting.
You've collected this many...
Your talent is remarkable!
Have you visited the SAFARI ZONE?
I hear there are some POKéMON that
can only be caught there.
You've finally reached the 100-kind
mark. This is an impressive POKéDEX!
There might be POKéMON that can be
found using ROCK SMASH.
You should get some more POKéMON by
trading with others.
I've heard of POKéMON that evolve when
they come to fully love their TRAINERS.
I had no idea that there were so many
POKéMON species in the HOENN region.
On occasion, some POKéMON appear in
large numbers like wild outbreaks.=Don't miss opportunities like those.
One can get a very good idea about the
POKéMON of the HOENN region by looking=through your POKéDEX.
I'd say you already qualify as a POKéMON
PROFESSOR, and a good one, too!
With a POKéDEX this complete, you're
a real professional at this!
You're very close to completing this
POKéDEX. I can feel it in my bones!
Congratulations!
Your POKéDEX is complete!
Hmhm...
On a nationwide basis...
You've seen @
 POKéMON,
and you've caught @

DAD: LANDON! Good to see you!
There's a letter here for you, LANDON.
DAD: I guess this is a PASS for a ship.
But I've never seen this ship before.
You should find out what this is about
in LILYCOVE.
The ferry to SLATEPORT is...
Oh?
That PASS...
Aye, mate, are you the one who brought
that mighty odd PASS?
I'll tell you, you're trying to reach a
tiny spit of an island far in the south.
There's no telling what we'll encounter
once we reach there, aye.=That shivers my timbers!
All aboard!
Aye, mate, there's nothing here to
see or do on this forgettable island.
What say we sail back to LILYCOVE?
Aye, right, then!
Sail home we will!
Aye, right, as you like, then.
"All dreams are but another reality.
Never forget..."2
"Those whose memories fade seek to
carve them in their hearts..."2




DAD: Hi, LANDON!
I just received a very rare BERRY.
I'd like you to have it.
If you see BERRIES growing in loamy
soil, feel free to take them.
But make sure you plant a BERRY in the
same spot. That's common courtesy.
Here, I'll share this with you.
The way you look, you must be a
TRAINER, no?
TRAINERS often make POKéMON hold
BERRIES.
It's up to you whether to grow BERRIES
or use them.
I watered my plants lots and lots!
A whole bunch of flowers bloomed!
And then a whole bunch of BERRIES
appeared!
Here you go!
You can have this!
I'm going to try really hard and make
some RED
I hope you try hard, too!
I wonder what color BERRIES I'll look
for today?
I'm gathering BERRIES so I can win a
POKéMON CONTEST.
If you'd like, I'll share one with you.
Good luck to you, too!
What BERRIES should I plant today?
What color
S should I make?
Fretting over stuff like that is fun
in its own way.
Give the case a shake, and out pops
...
And that
 is caught and eaten
by a POKéMON...
It's an expression of love, isn't it?
Yes, yes.
You understand what I mean.
You should take this.
Oh... But it is important to make your
own impressions, I guess...
You can have this.
I think that BERRY is rare.
I hope you raise it with loving care.
I'll get more BERRIES from the
BERRY MASTER.
When it gets right down to it...
The same way suits suit me perfectly,
a crisp breeze suits the sea.
And you, a BERRY suits you to a "T"2...
Why should that be so?
When it gets right down to it...
It's because you're a TRAINER!
When it gets right down to it...
The way dignified simplicity suits me,
S perfectly suit POKéMON.
You may call me the BERRY MASTER.
I dream of filling the world with
beautiful flowers, so I raise BERRIES=and hand them out to everyone.
You're deserving of one!
Why be stingy?
Take another!
Be sure to visit the PRETTY PETAL
flower shop near RUSTBORO.
Let flowers fill the world!
I'm done for today.
Come again another day.
Let flowers fill the world!
The way my husband grows BERRIES,
oh, he's the best in the world.
He makes me proud, that he does.
Incidentally, child, have you heard
a good saying lately?
Ah! What a remarkable saying!
Inspirational, it is!
I want you to have this.
Oh! A good saying it is.
You're quite remarkable.
I want you to have this.
Our four grandchildren should become
more accomplished than my husband.
Joy never goes out of my life!
Ah...
Hello!
This is the PRETTY PETAL flower shop.
Spreading flowers throughout the world!
LANDON
, would you like to learn about
BERRIES?
Your name is?
LANDON
That's a nice name.
LANDON
, would you like to learn about
BERRIES?
BERRIES grow on trees that thrive
only in dark, loamy soil.
If you take some BERRIES, be sure to
plant one in the loamy soil again.
A planted BERRY will soon sprout,
grow into a plant, flower beautifully,=then grow BERRIES again.
I want to see the whole wide world
filled with beautiful flowers.=That's my dream.
Please help me, LANDON
. Plant BERRIES
and bring more flowers into the world.
Flowers bring so much happiness to
people, don't they?
Hello!
The more attention you give to flowers,
the more beautifully they bloom.
You'll like tending flowers. I'm sure
of it. You can have this.
While BERRY plants are growing,
water them with the WAILMER PAIL.
Oh, another thing.
If you don't pick BERRIES for a while,
they'll drop off onto the ground.=But they'll sprout again.
Isn't that awesome?
It's like they have the will to live.
I'm trying to be like my big sisters.
I'm growing flowers, too!
Here you go! It's for you!
You can plant a BERRY and grow it big,
or you can make a POKéMON hold it.
But now they have a machine that mixes
up different BERRIES and makes candies=for POKéMON.
I want some candy, too.
Hi, what's your name?
... ... ...  ... ... ...  ... ... ...
Okay. That's nice!
My name is KIRI.
My mommy and daddy named me that so
I would grow healthy and warmhearted.=That's what they wished.
You can have one of these.
KIRI will give you this BERRY, too!
I really like it lots!
I wonder what kind of wish is included
in your name.
Spring, summer, autumn, and winter.
If you're born in springtime, do you like
the spring, and if you're born in the=summer, do you like the summer?
Then KIRI was born in the autumn,
so I love the autumn!
Which season do you like?
Oh...
It doesn't matter...
There's so much that I want to know...
Are you planning on going deep in
there?
How about bringing me back some
SHOAL SALT and SHOAL SHELLS?
I can make you something good if
you bring me the ingredients.
If you bring me four each of the
SHOAL SALT and SHOAL SHELLS,=I can make you a SHELL BELL...
You can get those ingredients
every day.
Oh, hey! SHOAL SALT and SHOAL
SHELLS! And enough of them, too!
Would you like me to make you a
SHELL BELL with them?
All righty, then! I'll make you a
SHELL BELL right away.
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
There! Done!
Have a POKéMON hold on to that.
It'll love it, that's for certain.
Why, the SHELL BELL's chime...
It's simply sublime!
You can get its ingredients every
day, so I can make you more.
Oh... Is that so...
I wanted to make a SHELL BELL...
There was some SHOAL SALT here.
But, there's nothing here now.
There was a SHOAL SHELL here.
But, there's nothing here now.
You don't have space in your BAG
if I were to make it for you.
You should make room and come back
for a SHELL BELL.
There's a set of POKéMON picture books.
It's filled with all sorts of books.
POKéMON magazines!
POKéMON PAL...
POKéMON HANDBOOK...
ADORABLE POKéMON...
This vase looks expensive...
Peered inside...
But, it was empty.
It's empty.
The shelves brim with all sorts of
POKéMON merchandise.
A blueprint of some sort?
It's too complicated!
Would you like to save the game?
There is already a saved file.
Is it okay to overwrite it?
SAVING...
DON'T TURN OFF THE POWER.
LANDON saved the game.
Save error...
There is a different game file that is
already saved.
Is it okay to overwrite it?
Hi! Sorry to keep you waiting!
Welcome to the world of POKéMON!
My name is BIRCH.
But everyone calls me the POKéMON
PROFESSOR.
This is what we call a "POKéMON."2
This world is widely inhabited by
creatures known as POKéMON.
We humans live alongside POKéMON,
at times as friendly playmates, and=at times as cooperative workmates.
And sometimes, we band together
and battle others like us.
But despite our closeness, we don't
know everything about POKéMON.
In fact, there are many, many
secrets surrounding POKéMON.
To unravel POKéMON mysteries,
I've been undertaking research.=That's what I do.
And you are?
Are you a boy?
Or are you a girl?
All right.
What's your name?
So it's LANDON
Ah, okay!
You're LANDON
 who's moving to my
hometown of LITTLEROOT.=I get it now!
All right, are you ready?
Your very own adventure is about
to unfold.
Take courage, and leap into the
world of POKéMON where dreams,=adventure, and friendships await!
Well, I'll be expecting you later.
Come see me in my POKéMON LAB.

This is a newly discovered POKéMON.
It is currently under investigation.
No detailed information is available
at this time.
BULBASAUR can be seen napping in
bright sunlight.
There is a seed on its back.
By soaking up the sun's rays, the seed
grows progressively larger.
There is a bud on this POKéMON's back.
To support its weight, IVYSAUR's legs
and trunk grow thick and strong.
If it starts spending more time lying
in the sunlight, it's a sign that the
bud will bloom into a large flower soon.
There is a large flower on VENUSAUR's
back. The flower is said to take on vivid
colors if it gets plenty of nutrition
and sunlight. The flower's aroma
soothes the emotions of people.
The flame that burns at the tip of its
tail is an indication of its emotions.
The flame wavers when CHARMANDER is
enjoying itself. If the POKéMON becomes
enraged, the flame burns fiercely.
CHARMELEON mercilessly destroys its
foes using its sharp claws.
If it encounters a strong foe, it turns
aggressive. In this excited state, the
flame at the tip of its tail flares with a
bluish white color.
CHARIZARD flies around the sky in
search of powerful opponents.
It breathes fire of such great heat
that it melts anything. However, it
never turns its fiery breath on any
opponent weaker than itself.
SQUIRTLE's shell is not merely used
for protection.
The shell's rounded shape and the
grooves on its surface help minimize
resistance in water, enabling this
POKéMON to swim at high speeds.
Its tail is large and covered with a rich,
thick fur. The tail becomes increasingly
deeper in color as WARTORTLE ages.
The scratches on its shell are evidence
of this POKéMON's toughness as a
battler.
BLASTOISE has water spouts that
protrude from its shell. The water
spouts are very accurate.
They can shoot bullets of water with
enough accuracy to strike empty cans
from a distance of over 160 feet.
CATERPIE has a voracious appetite.
It can devour leaves bigger than its
body right before your eyes.
From its antenna, this POKéMON releases
a terrifically strong odor.
The shell covering this POKéMON's body
is as hard as an iron slab.
METAPOD does not move very much.
It stays still because it is preparing
its soft innards for evolution inside
the hard shell.
BUTTERFREE has a superior ability to
search for delicious honey from
flowers.
It can even search out, extract, and
carry honey from flowers that are
blooming over six miles from its nest.
WEEDLE has an extremely acute sense
of smell.
It is capable of distinguishing its
favorite kinds of leaves from those it
dislikes just by sniffing with its big
red proboscis (nose).
