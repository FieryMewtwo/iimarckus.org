Hi! I'm WHITNEY!

Everyone was into
POKéMON, so I got
into it too!

POKéMON are
super-cute!

You want to bat-
tle? I'm warning
you--I'm good!


Sob...

...Waaaaaaah!
You're mean!

You shouldn't be
so serious! You...
you child, you!


Waaaaah!

Waaaaah!

...Snivel, hic...
...You meanie!


...Sniff...

What? What do you
want? A BADGE?

Oh, right.
I forgot. Here's
PLAINBADGE.


{A1} received
PLAINBADGE.


PLAINBADGE lets
your POKéMON use

STRENGTH outside
of battle.

It also boosts
your POKéMON's
SPEED.

Oh, you can have
this too!


It's ATTRACT!
It makes full use

of a POKéMON's
charm.

Isn't it just per-
fect for a cutie
like me?


Ah, that was a
good cry!

Come for a visit
again! Bye-bye!


Don't let my
POKéMON's cute

looks fool you.
They can whip you!


Darn... I thought
you were weak...


Do my POKéMON
think I'm cute?


I like cute POKé-
MON better than
strong POKéMON.

But I have strong
and cute POKéMON!


Oh, no, no, no!


I'm trying to beat
WHITNEY, but...
It's depressing.

I'm okay! If I
lose, I'll just

try harder next
time!


Oh, no. You made
WHITNEY cry.

It's OK. She'll
stop soon. She

always cries when
she loses.


Oh, you are a cute
little trainer! 

I like you, but I
won't hold back!


Let's see... Oops,
it's over?


Wow, you must be
good to beat me!
Keep it up!


Give it your best
shot, or I'll take
you down!


No! Oh, MEOWTH,
I'm so sorry!


I taught MEOWTH
moves for taking
on any type...


Yo! CHAMP in
making!

This GYM is home
to normal-type
POKéMON trainers.

I recommend you
use fighting-type
POKéMON.


You won? Great! I
was busy admiring
the ladies here.




...sigh... I moved
here, but I can't

sell my BICYCLES.
Why is that?

Could you ride a
BICYCLE and adver-
tise for me?


Really? Great!

Give me your name
and phone number,

and I'll loan you
a BICYCLE.


{A1} borrowed a
BICYCLE.


My BICYCLES are
first-rate! You

can ride them
anywhere.


...sigh... Oh, for
the kindness of
people...


Just released!

First-rate compact
BICYCLES!


It's a shiny new
BICYCLE!




If you treat your
POKéMON nicely,

they will love you
in return.

Oh? Let me see
your ...


It looks really
happy! It must
love you a lot.


I get the feeling
that it really
trusts you.


It's friendly to-
ward you. It looks
sort of happy.


It's quite cute.


You should treat
it better. It's
not used to you.


It doesn't seem to
like you at all.
It looks mean.


I keep losing in
battles, and my

POKéMON end up
fainting...

Maybe that's why
my POKéMON don't
like me much...


When I use an item
on my POKéMON, it
acts really glad!




BILL: Hi, {A1}!
Do us a favor and
take this EEVEE.

It came over when
I was adjusting
the TIME CAPSULE.

Someone has to
take care of it,

but I don't like
being outside.

Can I count on you
to play with it,
{A1}?


BILL: I knew you'd
come through!

Way to go! You're
the real deal!

OK, I'm counting
on you.

Take good care of
it!


{A1} received
EEVEE!


BILL: PROF.ELM
claims EEVEE may

evolve in new and
unknown ways.


Whoa, wait. You
can't carry any
more POKéMON.


Oh... Now what to
do?


BILL: My pop, he
won't work. All he
does is goof off
all day long.

He's getting to be
a real headache...


Oh, you collect
POKéMON? My son
BILL is an expert.

He just got called
to the POKéMON

CENTER in ECRUTEAK
CITY.

My husband went
off to the GAME

CORNER without
being called...


My husband was
once known as a

POKéMANIAC.
BILL must have

taken after his
father.


Are you a trainer?

I've got a useful
phone number for
you.


{A1} recorded
BILL's number.


My brother made
the PC POKéMON
storage system.

I was going to
give you BILL's
number...


You can't record
any more numbers.


My big brother
BILL made the PC

POKéMON storage
system.




The train hasn't
come in...

I know! I'll carry
the passengers on
my back!

That won't work.


We'll soon depart
for SAFFRON.

Are you coming
aboard?


May I see your
rail PASS, please?

OK. Right this
way, please.


Sorry. You don't
have a rail PASS.


We hope to see you
again!


We have arrived in
GOLDENROD.

We hope to see you
again.


I'm the PRESIDENT.

My dream was to
build a train that

is faster than any
POKéMON.

It really brings
JOHTO much closer
to KANTO.





Have you seen that
wiggly tree that's

growing on ROUTE
36?

My little sister
got all excited

and went to see
it...

I'm worried... Isn't
it dangerous?


Do you want to
borrow the water

bottle too?
I don't want you

doing anything
dangerous with it.


Oh, you're better
than WHITNEY...

You'll be OK,
then. Here's the
SQUIRTBOTTLE!


Don't do anything
too dangerous!


Lalala lalalala.
Have plenty of
water, my lovely!


When I told my sis
about the jiggly

tree, she told me
it's dangerous.

If I beat WHITNEY,
I wonder if she'll

lend me her water
bottle...


Wow, you beat
WHITNEY? Cool!


So it really was a
POKéMON!




Once while I was
battling, my

POKéMON couldn't
make any moves.

The POWER POINTS,
or PP, of its

moves were all
gone.


Sometimes, a
healthy POKéMON

may be unable to
use its moves.

If that happens,
heal it at a POKé-
MON CENTER or use
an item.




My POKéMON is an
expert at collect-
ing SWEET HONEY.

I'll share some
with you.


I want to give you
some SWEET HONEY,

but you have no
room for it.


Here you go! Have
some SWEET HONEY!


{A1} received
SWEET HONEY.


My little brother
takes SWEET HONEY

and goes somewhere
with it.

I wonder what he's
up to?


Did you put SWEET
HONEY on a tree?

What happened to
it?


Did you put SWEET
HONEY on a tree?

It takes about a
day for POKéMON to
be drawn to it.

Sorry. You can't

OK. Please save

Oh? You don't have

I always play this
slot machine. It

pays out more than
others, I think.


I just love this
new slot machine.

It's more of a
challenge than the
ones in CELADON.


Life is a gamble.
I'm going to flip
cards till I drop!


Card flip...

I prefer it over
the slots because

it's easier to
figure the odds.

But the payout is
much lower.


I won't quit until
I win!


I taught BLIZZARD
to my POKéMON.

It was hard to get
enough coins for

it, but it was
worth it.


I couldn't win at
the slots, and I

blew it on card
flipping...

I got so furious,
I tossed out my

COIN CASE in the
UNDERGROUND.


Wahahah! The coins
keep rolling in!


Someone left their
drink.

It smells sweet.




Hm? That's a POKé-
DEX, isn't it?
May I see it?

There are so many
kinds of POKéMON.

Hm? What's this?

What is this
POKéMON?

It looks like the
strange writing on

the walls of the
RUINS.

If those drawings
are really POKé-
MON, there should
be many more.

I know! Let me up-
grade your POKé-
DEX. Follow me.


What do you want?
I'm studying--
don't disturb me!


Sorry...
I'm frustrated by

our lack of real
understanding...


The RUINS are from
about 1500 years
ago.

Nobody knows who
built them.

It's also not
known if the POKé-
MON statues have
any meaning.

It's all one big
mystery...


Hmmm... This is a
strange place.

I like thinking
here.

THE AUTHORITY ON
THE RUINS OF ALPH


While exploring
the RUINS, we

suddenly noticed
an odd presence.

We all got scared
and ran away.

You should be
careful too.


The RUINS hide a
huge secret!

...I think...


There are many
kinds of UNOWN, so

we use them for
our secret codes.


A... H... E... A... D...
Hmm...

What?

I'm decoding this
message!




Patterns appeared
on the walls...


It's UNOWN text!


Patterns appeared

There's a big hole
in the wall!


It's a replica of
an ancient POKé-
MON.


A POKéMON that
flew gracefully on

rainbow-colored
wings.




Welcome to this
chamber.

There are sliding
panels that depict

a POKéMON drawn by
the ancients.

Slide the panels
around to form the
picture.

To the right is a
description of the
POKéMON.

Scientists in the
back are examining

some newly found
patterns.


Recently, strange,
cryptic patterns
have appeared.

It's odd. They
weren't here a
little while ago...

You should take a
look at the walls.


Ah! Here's another
huge hole!

It's big enough to
go through!


That tremor was
pretty scary!

But I'm more
concerned about
this wall here...


The patterns on
the wall appear to
be words!

And those sliding
stone panels seem

to be signals of
some kind.

I think they make
POKéMON appear,

but it's not clear
yet...

This is a big
room, but there's
nothing here.


This place has a
mystical quality
to it.

It feels sort of
ethereal even.


Ancient buildings
are often tombs of
kings.

Like the pyramids,
for instance.


It's a replica of
an ancient POKé-
MON.




Done!

I modified your
POKéDEX.

I added an
optional POKéDEX

to store UNOWN
data.

It records them in
the sequence that
they were caught.


{A1}'s POKéDEX
was upgraded.


The UNOWN you
catch will all be
recorded.

Check to see how
many kinds exist.


You caught all the
UNOWN variations?

That's a great
achievement!

I've set up the
printer here for
handling UNOWN.

Feel free to use
it anytime.


The RUINS are
about 1500 years
old.

But it's not known
why they were
built--or by whom.


I wonder how many
kinds of POKéMON
are in the RUINS?


POKéMON appeared
in the RUINS?

That's incredible
news!

We'll need to
investigate this.


Our investigation,
with your help, is

giving us insight
into the RUINS.

The RUINS appear
to have been built

as a habitat for
POKéMON.


There are odd pat-
terns drawn on the

walls of the
RUINS.

They must be the
keys for unravel-
ing the mystery
of the RUINS.


The strange POKé-
MON you saw in the
RUINS?

They appear to be
very much like the

drawings on the
walls there.

Hmm...

That must mean
there are many
kinds of them...


We think something
caused the cryptic

patterns to appear
in the RUINS.

We've focused our
studies on that.


According to my
research...

Those mysterious
patterns appeared

when the POKéCOM
CENTER was built.

It must mean that
radio waves have

some sort of a
link...


Why did those
ancient patterns

appear on the wall
now?

The mystery
deepens...

You're headed to

Let my POKéMON see
if you are good
enough to battle.


Oh, oh, oh!


All right, then!
I've decided.

I'm not leaving
until my POKéMON
get tougher!


I roam far and
wide in search of
POKéMON.

Are you looking
for POKéMON too?

Then you're my
collecting rival!


Ugh. My poor POKé-
MON...


Every Friday, you
can hear POKéMON

roars from deep
inside the cave.


Whoa! What a
surprise!

I didn't expect to
see anyone here!


Whoa! I'm beaten
big time!


I was conned into
buying a SLOWPOKE-
TAIL.

I feel sorry for
the poor POKéMON.


ZUBAT's SUPERSONIC
keeps confusing
my POKéMON.

I'm seriously
upset about that!


I flamed out!


On weekends, you
can hear strange

roars from deep in
the cave.


If it's light, a
cave isn't scary.

If you're strong,
POKéMON aren't
scary.


FLASH!


It's my POKéMON's
fire that lights
up this cave.


UNION CAVE




It's been a while
since I last saw
another person.

Don't be shy.
Let's battle!


Uurggh...


I've been lost for
a long time...

I don't mind it
here, but I am
soooo hungry!


What do you know!
A visitor!


Wahahah! You're a
feisty one!


I live down here.

You can, too, if
you'd like.

There's plenty of
room, you see.


Who's there?

Leave me and my
POKéMON alone!


Go...
Go away!


Just me and my
POKéMON. I'm de-
lirious with joy.


I came all the way
here to conduct my
POKéMON research.

Let me demonstrate
my findings in a
real battle!


You demonstrated
on me!


I should compile
and announce my
study findings.

I might even be-
come famous like
PROF.ELM.




There are two
kinds of people.

Those who have
style, and those
who don't.

What kind of
person are you?


You've got
dazzling style!


Your POKéMON style
is stunning and
colorful, I admit.

You'll just keep
getting better!


I'm in training.
Care for a round?


Aww, no! You're
too good for me.


I'm going to train
by myself until I
improve.


If the POKéMON I
liked were there,
I'd go anywhere.

That's what a real
trainer does.


I'd rather pet my
babies than this!


Just once a week,
a POKéMON comes to
the water's edge.

I wanted to see
that POKéMON...




KURT: Hey there,
{A1}!

The guard up top
took off when I
shouted at him.

But then I took a
tumble down the
WELL.

I slammed down
hard on my back,
so I can't move.

Rats! If I were
fit, my POKéMON

would've punished
them...

Ah, it can't be
helped.

{A1}, show them
how gutsy you are
in my place!


KURT: Way to go,
{A1}!

TEAM ROCKET has
taken off.

My back's better
too. Let's get out
of here.


Darn! I was stand-
ing guard up top

when some old coot
yelled at me.

He startled me so
much that I fell
down here.

I think I'll vent
my anger by taking
it out on you!


Arrgh! This is NOT
my day!


Sure, we've been
hacking the tails

off SLOWPOKE and
selling them.

Everything we do
is for profit.

That's right!
We're TEAM ROCKET,

and we'll do any-
thing for money!


What do you want?

If you interrupt
our work, don't
expect any mercy!


You did OK today,
but wait till next
time!


Yeah, TEAM ROCKET
was broken up
three years ago.

But we continued
our activities
underground.

Now you can have
fun watching us
stir up trouble!


Quit taking SLOW-
POKETAILS?

If we obeyed you,
TEAM ROCKET's rep
would be ruined!


Just...
Too strong...


We need the money,
but selling SLOW-
POKETAILS?

It's tough being a
ROCKET GRUNT!


Stop taking TAILS?

Yeah, just try to
defeat all of us!


You rotten brat!


SLOWPOKETAILS
grow back fast!

What's wrong with
selling them?


A SLOWPOKE with
its TAIL cut off...

Huh? It has MAIL.
Read it?


{A1} read the
MAIL.

Be good and look
after the house

with Grandpa and
SLOWPOKE.

Love, Dad


A SLOWPOKE with
its TAIL cut off...




I'm waiting to see
SLOWPOKE's moment
of evolution.

Through observa-
tion, I made a new
discovery.

A SLOWPOKE with a
KING'S ROCK often

gets bitten by a
SHELLDER.

Here, I'll share a
KING'S ROCK with
you.


I'm going to be
like SLOWPOKE.

I'll wait patient-
ly, so I can see
one evolve.




People train at
this LIGHTHOUSE.

It's not easy to
climb because of
all the trainers.


In the past, POKé-
MON used to light

the sea around
OLIVINE at night.

The LIGHTHOUSE was
made in honor of
those POKéMON.




Men of the sea are
always spoiling
for a good fight!


Urf!
I lose!


What power!
How would you like

to sail the seas
with me?


Hm? This is no
place for playing.


Ah! I can see that
you're serious.


Up top is a POKé-
MON that keeps the
LIGHTHOUSE lit.

But I hear that
it's sick now and

can't be cured by
ordinary medicine.


Man! You're as
tough as ever!

Anyway, here's
that medicine from
before.




Why are you here?
Are you just going

to gawk? I suggest
that you leave!


You really are
concerned...


How the heck do
you go up?

I want to visit
the sick POKéMON,

but I can't get up
there...


Sailors are both
kind and strong.
How about you?


You are both kind
and strong...


Every time I come
back to OLIVINE, I
visit the GYM.

The GYM LEADER's
POKéMON type has

changed without me
noticing.


I travel the world
to train my POKé-
MON. I wish to
battle with you.


...sigh... I must
train some more...


JASMINE used to
use rock POKéMON
like ONIX.




JASMINE must be
worried sick about
the POKéMON here.

She won't even
smile these days.


I can't manage a
smile either...


Speaking of sick,
I've heard there's

a good PHARMACY in
CIANWOOD.


JASMINE is this
city's GYM LEADER.

I mean to bring
her back with me.

Nobody had better
get in my way!


Aaack! My POKéMON!


Right. Anybody
would be worried
if his or her own
POKéMON were hurt.

I'll pray for the
POKéMON here, so

JASMINE can come
back to the GYM.




Look! Check out my
bag!

I printed out my
favorites from my
POKéDEX and stuck
them on my bag.


This is MAIL I got
from my daughter.
It cheers me up.


Pay attention,
please!

...Oops, I have to
quit thinking like

a teacher all the
time.

You must be a
POKéMON trainer.

Since you're work-
ing so hard, I

want you to have
this.


Let a POKéMON hold
that QUICK CLAW.

Sometimes it will
strike first
during battle.


I'm playing with
stickers I printed
from my POKéDEX.


I get the other
guy's POKéDEX
sticker if I win.


I take walks in
the PARK, but I

never go into the
grass.

Trainers always
want to battle...


PERSIAN: Fufushaa!


I'm printing out
my POKéDEX.

You can also print
out stuff like

MAIL and your PC
BOXES.


The world of
POKéMON is deep.

There are still
lots of things we
don't know.

But I know more
than you do!


Wha-wha-what?


There is a lot
to learn.

For example...

There are 50 kinds
of TMs.

Traded POKéMON
level up faster.


My POKéMON are
simply darling.

Let me tell you
how proud my
darlings make me.


I can beat you in
pride, but...


I must say, your
POKéMON are quite
cute, too.


We adore our POKé-
MON, even if they
dislike us.

That's what being
a FAN is about.


M-my POKéMON!


I lost the battle,
but my POKéMON win

the prize for
being most lovely.


My friend keeps a
MARILL!

I find them very
endearing.

Oh, I wish for a
MARILL of my own...


Hello? Why are you
staring at me?

Oh, a battle?


...Hmmm...


I thought you were
staring at me
because I'm cute!

We have recordings
of the cries of

all POKéMON that
have been found.

We must have about
200 kinds.


To trainers, POKé-
MON are their
beloved partners.

It's terrible how
TEAM ROCKET is

trying to control
POKéMON.


We run 24 hours a
day to broadcast

entertaining pro-
grams.

I'll do my best to
run around the
clock too!


The TEAM ROCKET
boss has locked
himself in.

But the DIRECTOR
can open it.

He's up on the
fifth floor.

Please save him!


Is the DIRECTOR
safe?


Thank you!
You're my hero!

This is a token of
my appreciation.


It's SUNNY DAY.
It powers up fire-
type moves for a
while.


You were simply
marvelous!


I've been given
strict orders.

I'm to crush any-
one who challenges
TEAM ROCKET!


What?!


I failed in my
duties...

I'll be docked pay
for this...


It feels great
ordering POKéMON
to commit crimes.


You're kidding!


I feel lousy over
losing!

Darn it! I hate
useless POKéMON!


Why did the shut-
ter open? Did you

have something to
do with this?


I'm done for!


What?! You made it
past our men in
the UNDERGROUND?

How could you?


An unknown child

That won't be pos-

No! Unbelievable!


I don't believe

Stop! I'm known as

fortress!

You're not taking
another step!


The fortress came
down!


You've earned my

some advice.

It's not too late.
You can still turn
back.


Don't I think
POKéMON are cute?

I'll think my

after they beat
yours!


Oh, no! They're so
useless!

Y-you! You came to

Is that what you
were expecting?

Wrong!
I'm an imposter!

I pretended to be
the real thing to

prepare for our
takeover.

Do you want to
know where we hid
the real DIRECTOR?

Sure, I'll tell
you. But only if
you can beat me!


OK, OK. I'll tell
you where he is.


We stashed the
real DIRECTOR in

the UNDERGROUND
WAREHOUSE.

It's at the far
end of the UNDER-
GROUND.

But I doubt you'll
get that far.


Remember me from
the HIDEOUT in

I lost then, but I
won't this time.


This can't be
happening!

I fought hard, but
I still lost...

A brat like you
won't appreciate

the magnificence
of TEAM ROCKET.

That's too bad.
I really admire
your power.


Oh? You managed to
get this far?

You must be quite

We intend to take
over this RADIO

STATION and an-
nounce our come-
back.

That should bring
our boss GIOVANNI

back from his solo
training.

We are going to
regain our former
glory.

I won't allow you
to interfere with
our plans.


No! Forgive me,
GIOVANNI!


How could this be?

Our dreams have
come to naught.

I wasn't up to the
task after all.

Like GIOVANNI did
before me, I will

disband TEAM
ROCKET here today.

Farewell.


DIRECTOR: {14},
thank you!

Your courageous
actions have saved

POKéMON nation-
wide.

I know it's not
much, but please
take this.


There used to be a
tower right here
in GOLDENROD CITY.

But it was old and
creaky.

So we replaced it
with our RADIO
TOWER.

We dug up that
bell during
construction.

I heard that all
sorts of POKéMON

lived in GOLDENROD
in the past.

Perhaps...

That bell has some
connection to the

TIN TOWER in
ECRUTEAK CITY...

Ah!

That reminds me...

I overheard TEAM
ROCKET whispering.

Apparently, some-
thing is going on
at the TIN TOWER.

I have no idea
what is happening,

but you might look
into it.

OK, I better go to
my OFFICE.


DIRECTOR: Hello,
{14}!

You know, I love
POKéMON.

I built this RADIO
TOWER so I could

express my love
of POKéMON.

It would be nice
if people enjoyed
our programs.

Hello! Welcome to
POKéCOM CENTER
TRADE CORNER.

You can trade
POKéMON with other
people far away.


To make a trade,
we must hold your
POKéMON.

Would you like to
trade?


What kind of
POKéMON do you
want in return?


Fine. We will try
to trade your

 for
.

We'll have to hold
your POKéMON
during the trade.

Please wait while
we prepare the
room for it.


Fine. We will try
to trade your

 for a
POKéMON that you
have never seen.

We'll have to hold
your POKéMON
during the trade.

Please wait while
we prepare the
room for it.


Your trade POKéMON
has been received.

It will take time
to find a trade

partner. Please
come back later.


Oh? You have only
one POKéMON in
your party. 

Please come back
once you've in-
creased the size
of your party.


We hope to see you
again.


Communication
error...


If we accept that
POKéMON, what will
you battle with?


Sorry. We can't
accept an EGG.


Sorry, but your
POKéMON appears to

be abnormal. We
can't accept it.


Oh? Aren't we
already holding a
POKéMON of yours?


We'll check the
rooms.

Please wait.


Thank you for your
patience.

A trade partner
has been found.


It's your new
partner.

Please take care
of it with love.

We hope to see you
again.


Uh-oh. Your party
is already full.

Please come back
when you have room
in your party.


It's unfortunate,
but no one has

come forward as a
trade partner.

Would you like
your POKéMON back?


We have returned
your POKéMON.


It's unfortunate,
but no one has

come forward as a
trade partner.

We've held your
POKéMON for a long

time. As a result,
it is very lonely.

Sorry, but we must
return it to you.


We hope to see you
again.


Fine. We will
continue to hold
your POKéMON.


Oh? You left your
POKéMON with us
only recently.

Please come back
later.


We'll SAVE before
connecting to the
CENTER.


Which POKéMON do
you want to trade?


Sorry, but we must
cancel the trade.


Oh!

I see you have an
EGG TICKET!

It's a coupon that
special people can

redeem for a
special POKéMON!


Let me give you a
quick briefing.

Trades held at the
TRADE CORNER are

between two
trainers who don't

know each other's
identity.

As a result, it
may take time.

However, an ODD
EGG is available
just for you.

It will be sent to
you right away.

Please choose one
of the rooms in

the CENTER.
An ODD EGG will be

sent from the
chosen room.


Please wait a
moment.


Thank you for
waiting.

We received your
ODD EGG.

Here it is!

Please raise it
with loving care.


I'm awfully sorry.

The EGG TICKET
exchange service
isn't running now.

Whoa, this POKéMON
CENTER is huge.

They just built
this place. They

installed lots of
new machines too.


I thought up a fun
new thing for the
TRADE CORNER!

I make a PIDGEY
hold MAIL, then

put it up for
trade for another
one!

If everyone did
that, MAIL could

be traded with all
sorts of people!

I call it PIDGEY
MAIL!

If it becomes
popular, I might

make lots of new
friends!


They said you can
trade POKéMON with

total strangers up
here.

But they're still
adjusting things.


Some girl I don't
know sent me her

HOPPIP.
You should trade

for a POKéMON that
you want.


I received a
female HOPPIP, but
its named STANLEY!

That's my dad's
name!


What is the NEWS
MACHINE?

Does it get news
from a wider area
than the radio?


The POKéCOM CENTER
will link with all

POKéMON CENTERS in
a wireless net.

That must mean
I'll be able to

link with all
sorts of people.


The machines here
can't be used yet.

Still, it's nice
coming to a trendy

place before other
people.


My friend was in
the NEWS a while

back. I was really
surprised!


I get anxious if I
don't check out
the latest NEWS!


If I get in the
NEWS and become

famous, I bet I'll
be adored.

I wonder how I
could get in the
NEWS?


The COLOSSEUM
upstairs is for
link battles.

Battle records are
posted on the

wall, so I can't
afford to lose.


I came over here
when I got word

that GOLDENROD's
POKéMON CENTER has

new machines that
no one's ever seen
before.

But it looks like
they're still busy

with all their
preparations...


Just seeing all
these new things
here makes me feel
younger!


A higher level
POKéMON doesn't
always win.

After all, it may
have a type dis-
advantage.

I don't think
there is a single

POKéMON that is
the toughest.


{A1}, isn't it?

Congratulations!

As a special deal,
a GS BALL has been
sent just for you!

Please accept it!

the world can link
without barriers!

...... ...... ......




ILEX FOREST is
big. Be careful!
Don't get lost.


The FOREST is
watched over by
its protector.

Stay out of
mischief!




Oh, honey. You're
making a POKéDEX?

It must be hard if
POKéMON won't

appear. Try using
this TM.


It's SWEET SCENT.

Use it wherever
POKéMON appear.

POKéMON will be
enticed by it.


Something's wrong
in ILEX FOREST...

You should stay
away right now.


BUTTERFREE: Freeh!


Did you see the
shrine honoring
the protector?

It watches over
the FOREST from
across time.

I think that it
must be a grass-
type POKéMON.




Gramps was looking
for you.


I'm the DAY-CARE
MAN.

There's something
new in GOLDENROD

called the TRADE
CORNER.

I was given an EGG
TICKET that can be

traded in for a
ODD EGG.

But since we run a
DAY-CARE, we don't

need it. You may
as well have it.


I'm the DAY-CARE
MAN.

Do you know about
EGGS?

I was raising
POKéMON with my
wife, you see.

We were shocked to
find an EGG!

How incredible is
that?

Well, wouldn't you
like this EGG?

Then fine, this is
yours to keep!


Come again.


{A1} received
ODD EGG!


I found that when
I was caring for

someone's POKéMON
before.

But the trainer
didn't want the

EGG, so I'd kept
it around.


You've no room for
this.




I hate having to
hang up on you!

Call you later!


{14}, have you
heard?

GOLDENROD's RADIO
TOWER has been

taken over by TEAM
ROCKET!

...Um... What's TEAM
ROCKET?


{14}, I heard!

You defeated that
WHITNEY?

It makes me proud
to be your friend!


Hey, I heard about
you!

You saved that
POKéMON at the

LIGHTHOUSE, didn't
you?

{14}, I wish
you'd come see me

when I'm sick in
bed with a cold!


I heard, I heard,
I heard!

You smashed TEAM
ROCKET's hideout!

You're like a
movie hero, even!

But um... What was
TEAM ROCKET?


I heard, I heard,
I heard!

About your heroic
liberation of the

RADIO TOWER! You
rock so hard!


I saw, I saw!

I saw you go into
the DRAGON'S DEN!

I'm certain you
passed! Aww, no

need to be modest!
You can't fail!


Yesterday, I went
out to NEW BARK

TOWN.  There was a
lady who looked a

lot like you,
{14}.

What? That lady
was your mom?

Aww, I should've
introduced myself!

I bet your mom's
really proud of

all that you've
accomplished.

Heh, put it this
way. I'd be proud

if I were your
mom, believe me!


I saw, I saw,
I saw!

You striding onto
a ship, {14}!

I can't get over
how good you look

with the sea as
your backdrop!


I heard, I heard!

You got a MAGNET
TRAIN PASS!

When I saw you
departing on the

ship, I felt sad
that I wouldn't be

able to see you
for a while.

But since you have
that PASS, you can

zip back anytime!
That's reassuring!

What? You can FLY
back anytime?

What do you mean
by FLY?


I saw, I saw!

You waking up
SNORLAX!

I was watching you
from afar, so I

couldn't tell what
you did exactly.

Did you play a
flute to wake it?

Wow! That's like
magic!


I hear rumors
about you all over
the place.

It just makes me
sigh, {14}.

How did you get so
strong?

Go for the world
championship now!

I'll always be
cheering you on!


Hehe, I called
right away!

I think we can be
good friends!


I saw, I heard!

You beat MORTY of
ECRUTEAK GYM!

Th-that's just
incredible!

I actually went to
the GYM's entrance

to cheer you on.
Did you know that?

But everyone was
floating, and

there were ghosts
all over! So I

chickened out and
took off for home...


{14}, I heard!

You're kicking up
a mighty ruckus

over in KANTO!
What a glorious

rampage it must
be!

You so rock!


Hearing about your
escapades rocks my

soul!
It sure does!


I'm so glad you
called!

I was just about
to call you too!

I guess we must be
a good match!


How are you?

What are you
doing?

Where are you?

How many BADGES do
you have now?

How much money
have you saved?

How's your mom?

Have you got lots
of POKéMON?

Is it going to be
sunny tomorrow?

Arrgh, there's so
much I want to

chat about! This
is going nowhere!


I'm always with my
!

It's so cute!
I just love it!


Changing the topic
here, I saw this

 for the
first time.

It was easy to
beat, actually.


I was wondering,
do you happen to
have ?

I can't seem to
catch one. What is

its weakness, I
wonder.


Hey, let's battle
our POKéMON!

I won't lose to
you battling or in

the Bug-Catching
Contest!

I'll be here on
!


Let's talk again,
huh?


Boy, am I glad I
caught you!

A whole bunch of
 have

appeared around
!

You have to see
this!


I haven't had any
luck seeing rare
POKéMON lately...

But I know they're
out there!


Hey, where are you
now?

Let's battle. I'll
be waiting for you
on !


Hello? Are you
coming or what?

You're missing out
on seeing YANMA!

Get down to ROUTE
35 right now!


My 's
getting stronger,

exactly as I
calculated!


By the way, we
knocked out a wild

 just
the other day.

Studying up in
advance worked!


By the way, a wild
 escaped
on me yesterday.

A computational
error on my part...


I've studied quite
a bit since then,

and I've gotten a
lot better!

I'm hanging out on
.

Can you come down
for a battle?


See you later!


Hehehe, I picked
up something nice!

You can have it!
Why don't you come

to 
and pick it up?


I haven't picked
up anything yet.

I'll call you if I
find something.


If we don't battle
soon, I'll forget
my strategy!

I'm waiting on
!


I have to do my
homework, so can

you come get your
gift right away?

I'm waiting on
!


My  is
getting prettier!

I've been taking
photos galore!


It took only an
instant to KO a
wild .

It must be because
you gave me some

battling tips last
time.


You know what?
A wild 

got away from me
again.

It was so close!
Really, just a

little bit more,
and I would've...


Right now, I'm on
.

If you're close
by, let's battle!

I'll be waiting
for you!


See you!


You know what?
I got a good gift!

As I promised,
it's yours!

I'm sure you'd
like it. Come get

it! I'm waiting on
!


Oh! You wanted a
gift, right?

I got one, but I
want to keep this.


Can you wait a bit
longer?


Hi! You haven't
forgotten about

your promise to
battle me?

I'm waiting on
!


Hello?

If you don't come
get your present

soon, I'll give it
to someone else.

I'm waiting on
!


I recently began
observing wild
.

I've been learning
all sorts of new

things through my
observations.

I wish I could
become a POKéMON

researcher like
PROF.OAK soon.


Oh yes, I managed
to knock out a

wild  a
while back.

Well, considering
all the studying I

do every day, it
was inevitable.


Oh yes, I came
close to catching

a wild ,
but it got away.

For the longest
time, I've been

wanting to observe
. Rats...


Want to battle?
I have to battle

every so often to
avoid rusting out.

I'll be on
!


See you later!


Do you know BLUE?

He's PROF.OAK's
grandson and a

former POKéMON
LEAGUE CHAMPION!

He's one super
POKéMON trainer!


PROF.OAK has a
granddaughter
named DAISY.

When she's around,
even the most

ferocious POKéMON
calm right down.


Everyone's talking
about PROF.ELM.

He used to be an
assistant to the
great PROF.OAK!

That is so cool!
I envy him!


PROF.OAK's dream
is to compile a

comprehensive
POKéDEX.

I envy you for
taking part in
that project...


Do you know KURT,
the BALL creator?

He and PROF.OAK go
back a long way.

I guess great
people attract one
another!


POKéMON LEAGUE is
the great gather-
ing place for all

trainers who wish
to become CHAMP.

PROF.OAK acts as
an advisor to the

POKéMON LEAGUE's
headquarters.

He really is a
great man.


PROF.OAK'S POKéMON
TALK is a popular
radio show, right?

Did you know that
he was going to

turn down the show
at first?

But MARY's energy
and persistence
wore him down.

So we have MARY to
thank for it!


PROF.OAK used to
be a trainer a
long time ago.

But rather than
battling, he found

POKéMON themselves
to be interesting.

So he abandoned
his training to

focus on becoming
a researcher.


PROF.OAK has a
granddaughter
named DAISY.

She has tea every
day for an hour

from three in the
afternoon.

I wish I could
join her for tea

and chat about
PROF.OAK.


Did you know?
PROF.OAK traveled

all over the world
when he was young.

While traveling,
he must've learned

about POKéMON
naturally.

I envy him...
I'd like to travel

and learn about
things too...


I'm going to study
hard so PROF.OAK

will make me his
assistant!


Do you remember
about our battle?

The place is
.

Hurry over--I'm
waiting.


Listen to this.
My 

grins happily when
I pinch its cheek.

But it never grins
for anyone else.

I must be special.


Oh, and recently,
my PIKACHU beat a
wild !

A wild ,
I tell you!

Don't you think
that's astounding?

My PIKACHU is
awesome!

My PIKACHU is the
greatest!


Oh, and I saw a
wild  a
little while ago.

But it wasn't very
cute, so I left

it...
POKéMON have to be

cute. They're no
good otherwise.


Well, let's talk
again!


Did you remember?
The Bug-Catching
Contest is today.

You're going to
go, aren't you?

I think I'll
participate with

PIKACHU to show
off its cuteness.


I'd like you to
have a NUGGET.

My PIKACHU just
loves it.

I'm certain your
PIKACHU will love
it too!


How is your
PIKACHU doing?

Let's get together
and brag about our
PIKACHU!


What's wrong?

I'm waiting on
.

Come pick this up
anytime.


My  has
grown again.

It was only about
so big when I

caught it, but now
it's way bigger.


Oh yeah, I KO'd a
wild .

It was huge, like
this big even.

Heh, I guess you
can't tell over
the phone...


Oh yeah, I lost a
wild .

It was huge, like
this big even.

Heh, I guess you
can't tell over
the phone...


We should get a
battle going!

I'll be fishing on
.

Swing by if you
have the time.


Well, I'll be
seeing you.


I picked up a good
little thing at
the water's edge.

Like I promised,
it's yours.

I'll be waiting on
.


Have I found
anything good?

Nope, not yet.

It's like fishing,
you need patience.


Yup, TULLY here...

{14}? What?
You're lost?

Our battle will be
on .


I've got something
good for you.

Hustle over to
.


Oh yeah, I got an
extremely rare

POKéMON in a trade
a while back.

Do you want to
know what it is?

Hehe, I'm keeping
it a secret!


Oh yeah, I took
down this wild

.
It wasn't rare

enough to bother
catching.


Oh yeah, I saw a
rare POKéMON about
an hour ago.

It was my first
sighting. But I

didn't have any
POKé BALLS...

Would BILL laugh
at my mistakes?


You've got time
like usual, right?

Feel like having a
battle?

It'll be a chance
to see my rare

POKéMON. It'll be
worth your time!

You know where--
.


So that's it then.


Did you know...?
BILL's father is

supposed to be a
great POKéMANIAC.


Did you know...?
Apparently BILL's

grandpa isn't a
POKéMANIAC.


Did you know...?
BILL's originally
from GOLDENROD.


Did you know...?
BILL evidently

lives on ROUTE 25
in KANTO.


Did you know...?
ABRA was the first

POKéMON that BILL
ostensibly caught.


Did you know...?
BILL's younger

sister apparently
can't wink.


Did you know...?
BILL supposedly

hates milk and
can't drink it.


Did you know...?
Evidently, BILL

isn't very good at
battling.


Did you know...?
BILL appears to

like the lady at
the FLOWER SHOP.


Did you know...?
BILL's mother is

said to have been
a KIMONO GIRL.


You wanted to hear
about BILL?

Sorry, but I'm too
busy for you.

I'll call when I
have time.


You want to see my
rare POKéMON.

Hurry over to
.


My 's
adorable, don't

you think so?
I always sleep

with it--it's so
fluffy and warm!


Oh, and we had to
battle a wild

 a while
ago...

My CLEFAIRY came
close to fainting!

Isn't that awful?

I hate those nasty
!


Oh, and we had to
battle a wild

 a while
ago...

My CLEFAIRY got
frightened, so we

ran away as fast
as we could!

I just can't help
feeling protective
of my CLEFAIRY.


I know this might
surprise you, but

would you like to
battle?

I'll be waiting
with CLEFAIRY on
.

!

It's awful.
My CLEFAIRY...

Huh? {14}?

Oh, sorry! I was
in a hurry, and I...

I have to go!
Bye-bye!


Bye-bye!


I bought some PINK
BOWS at GOLDENROD

DEPT.STORE for my
CLEFAIRY.

I got too many, so
I'll give you one!

Come collect it on
.


I love dressing up
my CLEFAIRY!


What's wrong?
Can't you visit?

CLEFAIRY got tired
and fell asleep.

I'm not sure if I
can wake it up...

Please hurry to
!


What's wrong?
Can't you visit?

I'm sure this will
look good on your
CLEFAIRY.

Please hurry to
!


My 's
become tougher.

We've achieved
liftoff!


We can easily beat
!

...Huh? You too?
Isn't that great?


But get this, a
wild 

just barely eluded
us.

I wanted to FLY
after it...


Right now, I'm on
.

You know, where I
first met you?

Want to battle?
I'll wait here.


OK, bye for now!


I'll be looking
forward to our
next battle!


Oh, {14}!
Hurry, hurry!

!
FLY over now!


My 's
grown impressive!

My fishing skills
have improved too!


We beat a wild
...

You know, I have
more fun fishing

than beating wild
POKéMON.


But a while back,
we came this close

to landing a wild
.

I tell you, it was
huge. Believe me.


I'm fishing on
,

but nothing's
biting today.

Help me while my
time away, come
over for a battle.


All right, later.


I snagged an item
while fishing.

Come pick it up on
.


Nah, I haven't
found anything

that's worth your
time.

You have to have
patience.


Sigh...
They're not biting

like before on
...

You have to come
for a battle!


Don't you want
this item?

Hah? You don't
know where?

...
Just head from

MAHOGANY toward
BLACKTHORN!


Anyway, we'll chat
again!


Are you still on
your journey?

I remain dedicated
to my training.

Oooooaaarrrgh!


I'm in training
now. I apologize,

but call me back
another time.

Oooooaaarrrgh!


I apologize, but I
don't have time to

chat while I am in
training!

I'll have time to
chat tomorrow!

Yiiihah!


I plan to take a
lunch break, so

come see me then!
Ayiiiyah!


I'm taking a break
on ROUTE 45!

Why not drop by if
you are free?


I rested up over
my lunch break.

Now it's time to
resume training!

Oooryaah!


Nothing can match
my  now.


Yeah, we KO'd a
wild !

That was OK, but I
wanted to get it...


And yesterday, we
spotted a wild

.
We were debating

whether to catch
it or beat it.

When along came
another guy who

caught it!
How about that!


You're thinking
you'd like to

battle me. Am I
right or what?

Yep! We'll meet on
!


OK, give me a call
again!


You'll battle with
me again, right?


Haven't you gotten
to ?

Waiting here isn't
bad, but I'd sure
like to battle!


's 
is much stronger
than before!


And, and...
I just battled and
beat !

I've raised my
POKéMON properly!


But, but...

A wild 
got away from me

again. It's just
not fair!


I'm ERIN. Want to
battle me again?

I won't lose this
time!

I'll be waiting on
!


See you. Bye-bye!


I'm working hard
to raise my
POKéMON!

Come back for
another battle!


Oh, {14}!
Come battle ERIN!

I'll be waiting on
!




There's no cheat-
ing in POKéMON.

Let's keep it fair
and square!


Huh? How did this
happen?


I fought fair and
square with honor.

I don't regret
this at all.


It itches and
tickles a bit when

I wear shorts in
the grass.


Aiyaaah!
I got stomped!


I'm going to catch
more POKéMON in
the grass.


...


...


...

I lost while I had
my eyes closed...


I can see it...

Everything to see
about you...


I couldn't foresee
your power...


Strength in con-
viction...

You're strong be-
cause you believe
in your POKéMON.


ROUTE 11




When you first
catch a POKéMON,
it may be weak.

But it will even-
tually grow to be
strong.

It's important to
treat POKéMON with
love.


POKéMON can hold
items like POTION
and ANTIDOTE.

But they don't
appear to know how

to use manmade
items.




I'm FALKNER, the
VIOLET POKéMON GYM
leader!

People say you can
clip flying-type

POKéMON's wings
with a jolt of
electricity...

I won't allow such
insults to bird
POKéMON!

I'll show you the
real power of the

magnificent bird
POKéMON!


...Darn! My dad's
cherished bird
POKéMON...

All right.
Take this.

It's the official
POKéMON LEAGUE
ZEPHYRBADGE.


{A1} received
ZEPHYRBADGE.


ZEPHYRBADGE
raises the attack
power of POKéMON.

It also enables
POKéMON to use

FLASH, if they
have it, anytime.

Here--take this
too.


By using a TM, a
POKéMON will

instantly learn a
new move.

Think before you
act--a TM can be
used only once.

TM31 contains
MUD-SLAP.

It reduces the
enemy's accuracy

while it causes
damage.

In other words, it
is both defensive
and offensive.


There are POKéMON
GYMS in cities and
towns ahead.

You should test
your skills at
these GYMS.

I'm going to train
harder to become

the greatest bird
master!


The keyword is
guts!

Those here are
training night and

day to become bird
POKéMON masters.

Come on!


Gaaah!


FALKNER's skills
are for real!

Don't get cocky
just because you
beat me!


Let me see if you
are good enough to
face FALKNER!


This can't be
true!


This is pathetic,
losing to some
rookie trainer...


Hey! I'm no train-
er but I can give
some advice!

Believe me!
If you believe, a

championship dream
can come true.

You believe?
Then listen.

The grass-type is
weak against the

flying-type. Keep
this in mind.


Nice battle! Keep
it up, and you'll

be the CHAMP in no
time at all!

EARL, I am!

Wonderful are
POKéMON, yes!

Teach you I will
to be a better
trainer!

What you want to
know? Want to be
a winner is you?


Good! Teach you,
I will!

In battle, POKéMON
top on list jump
out first!

Change order in
list, make battle
easy, maybe!

More from me you
want to hear?


So, want to know
how to raise
POKéMON well?


Fine! Teach you,
I will!

If POKéMON come
out in battle even

briefly, some EXP.
Points it gets.

At top of list put
weak POKéMON.

Switch in battle
quick!

This way, weak
POKéMON strong
become!


Oh! Smart student
you are! Nothing
more do I teach!

Good to POKéMON
you must be!


I'm taking notes
of the teacher's
lecture.

I'd better copy
the stuff on the
blackboard too.


I traded my best
POKéMON to the
guy beside me.


Huh? The POKéMON I
just got is hold-
ing something!


A POKéMON holding
a BERRY will heal
itself in battle.

Many other items
can be held by
POKéMON...

It sure is tough
taking notes...


The blackboard
describes POKéMON

status changes in
battle.


Read which topic?


If poisoned, a
POKéMON steadily
loses HP.

Poison lingers
after the battle,

and HP is lost as
you walk.

To cure it, use an
ANTIDOTE.


Paralysis reduces
speed and may
prevent movement.

It remains after
battle, so use
a PARLYZ HEAL.


If asleep, your
POKéMON can't make
a move.

A sleeping POKéMON
doesn't wake up
after battle.

Wake it up with
an AWAKENING.


A burn steadily
consumes HP.

It also reduces
attack power.

A burn lingers
after battle.

Use a BURN HEAL as
the cure.


If your POKéMON is
frozen, it can't
do a thing.

It remains frozen
after battle.

Thaw it out with
an ICE HEAL.


It's this kid's
notebook...

Catch POKéMON
using POKé BALLS.

Up to six can be
in your party.

Keep reading?


Before throwing a
POKé BALL, weaken
the target first.

A poisoned or
burned POKéMON is
easier to catch.

Keep reading?


Some moves may
cause confusion.

Confusion may make
a POKéMON attack
itself.

Leaving battle
clears up any
confusion.

Keep reading?


People who catch
and use POKéMON

in battle are
POKéMON trainers.

They are expected
to visit POKéMON

GYMS and defeat
other trainers.

GREGG




{14}, long
time, no see.

PROF.ELM asked me
to find you.

He has another
favor to ask.

Would you take the
POKéMON EGG?


We discovered that
a POKéMON will not

hatch until it
grows in the EGG.

It also has to be
with other active
POKéMON to hatch.

{14}, you're
the only person
we can rely on.

Please call PROF.
ELM when that EGG
hatches!


Oh, no. You can't
carry any more
POKéMON with you.

I'll wait here
while you make
room for the EGG.


B-but... PROF.ELM
asked for you...


{14}, will you
take the EGG?


I've been thinking
it'd be great to

be able to link up
and battle with my

friends who live
far away.


I just battled a
friend in CIANWOOD
over a link.

If you connect a
MOBILE ADAPTER,

you can link with
a friend far away.


A guy named BILL
made the POKéMON
PC storage system.


It was around
three years ago.

TEAM ROCKET was up
to no good with
POKéMON.

But justice pre-
vailed--a young
kid broke 'em up.


POKéMON are smart.
They won't obey a

trainer they don't
respect.

Without the right
GYM BADGES, they

will just do as
they please.




A POKéMON you get
in a trade grows
quickly.

But if you don't
have the right GYM

BADGE, they may
disobey you.




RUINS OF ALPH

A Look-and-Touch
Tourist Site

Try the sliding
stone panels!


You're studying
the RUINS?

I see a scientist
in the making.


There are drawings
on stone panels.

I tried moving
them. I wonder
what they are.




This is a great
fishing spot.

You saw people
fishing? How
about you?

Would you like one
of my RODS?


Heh, that's good
to hear.

Now you're an
angler too!


Fishing is great!

If there's water,
be it the sea or a

stream, try out
your ROD.


Oh. That's rather
disappointing...


Yo, kid. How are
they biting?


What should I make
my POKéMON hold?

Maybe an item that
increases ATTACK
power...




DARK CAVE leads
to another road

KENYA
RANDY




Excuse me, kid!
Can you do a guy
a favor?

Can you take this
POKéMON with MAIL
to my friend?

He's on ROUTE 31.


You will? Perfect!
Thanks, kid!

My pal's a chubby
guy who snoozes
all the time.

You'll recognize
him right away!


{A1} received a
POKéMON with MAIL.


You can read it,
but don't lose it!
ROUTE 31!

Oh, yeah. There
was a weird tree
blocking the road.

I wonder if it's
been cleared?


You can't carry
another POKéMON...


Oh... Never mind,
then...


Thanks, kid! You
made the delivery
for me!

Here's something
for your trouble!


My pal was snooz-
ing, right? Heh,
what'd I say?


A strange tree is
blocking the road.

It wriggles around
if you talk to it.

I heard it became
wild when someone

watered it with a
SQUIRTBOTTLE.


I like the POKéMON
Lullaby they play
on the radio.


I wonder how many
kinds of POKéMON

there are in the
world.

Three years ago,
PROF.OAK said that

there were 150
different kinds.




Today's .
That means the

Bug-Catching Con-
test is on today.

The rules are sim-
ple.

Using one of your
POKéMON, catch a

bug POKéMON to be
judged.

Would you like to
give it a try?


Here are the PARK
BALLS for the
Contest.


{A1} received
20 PARK BALLS.


The person who
gets the strong-
est bug POKéMON
is the winner.

You have 20
minutes.

If you run out of
PARK BALLS, you're
done.

You can keep the
last POKéMON you
catch as your own.

Go out and catch
the strongest bug

POKéMON you can
find!


Uh-oh...

You have more than
one POKéMON.

You'll have to use
, the

first POKéMON in
your party.

Is that OK with
you?


Fine, we'll hold
your other POKéMON
while you compete.


{A1}'s POKéMON
were left with the
CONTEST HELPER.


Please choose the
POKéMON to be used

in the Contest,
then come see me.


OK. We hope you'll
take part in the
future.


Uh-oh...
The first POKéMON

in your party
can't battle.

Please switch it
with the POKéMON

you want to use,
then come see me.


Uh-oh...
Both your party

and your PC BOX
are full.

You have no room
to put the bug
POKéMON you catch.

Please make room
in your party or

your PC BOX, then
come see me.


Uh-oh...
You have an EGG as

the first POKéMON
in your party.

Please switch it
with the POKéMON

you want to use,
then come see me.


You still have 
minute(s) left.

Do you want to
finish now?


OK. Please wait at
the North Gate for

the announcement
of the winners.


OK. Please get
back outside and
finish up.


Today's Contest is
over. We hope you

will participate
in the future.


We hold Contests
regularly in the

PARK. You should
give it a shot.


When is the next
Bug-Catching Con-
test going to be?


The Bug-Catching
Contest is held on

Tuesday, Thursday
and Saturday.

Not only do you
earn a prize just

for participating,
you also get to

keep the bug
POKéMON you may

have at the end of
the contest.




Don't you wonder
who'd make some-
thing like this?
And why?


Did you see that
strange tree in
the road?

That may explain
why fewer people

are visiting the
RUINS OF ALPH.

Some POKéMON can
only be seen in
the PARK.


DON: Wow, you beat
me. You're pretty
good.


DON: Luck plays a
big part in this.

You never know
what POKéMON will
appear.


ED: I envy you.
I just couldn't
do it this time.


ED: Maybe you win
with big POKéMON?


NICK: Well done!
I'm going to raise
my POKéMON better.


NICK: Maybe you
get a higher score

for a POKéMON of
an unusual color.


WILLIAM: You're
the winner? What
did you catch?


WILLIAM: Well, I'm
satisfied because

I caught a POKéMON
that I wanted.


BENNY: Congrats!
You have earned my
respect!


BENNY: I caught a
SCYTHER before,
but I didn't win.


BARRY: That POKé-
MON you caught...
it's awesome!


BARRY: It's easier
to win if you get

a high-level bug
POKéMON.

But I think they
also consider some
other points.


CINDY: You won?
That's great!

Do you feel like
looking for bug
POKéMON with me?


CINDY: I really
love bug POKéMON!


JOSH: I... I can't
believe I lost at
bug-catching...


JOSH: I heard that
somebody won with
a CATERPIE!


SAMUEL: Next time,
I'm going to win.


SAMUEL: Darn.
I thought I would
score higher...


KIPP: Could you
give me some tips?

I want to study
your style.


KIPP: I study a
lot, but that's

not good enough to
win.


I hear there's a
POKéMON that looks
just like a tree.

You can reveal its
identity using a
SILPHSCOPE 2.


The Bug-Catching
Contest is held on

Tuesday, Thursday
and Saturday.

Not only do you
earn a prize just

for participating,
you also get to

keep the bug
POKéMON you may

have at the end of
the contest.


Uh-oh... Your PACK
is full.

We'll hold on to
your prize, but
only for today.

Please make room,
then come see me.


{A1}?

Here's the prize
we were holding
for you.




We're the KANTO
POKéMON FEDERATION
trainer group.

We'll drive you
under our wheels!


S-sorry!


The KANTO POKéMON
FEDERATION will
never fall!


The cops shut down
our UNDERGROUND

PATH! That really
fries me!


F-forgive me!


Wiped out by some
punk from JOHTO...


We're the KANTO
POKéMON FEDERA-
TION!
Right on!


Yikes! Sorry!


We'll try not to
disturb anyone
from now on...


How does the MAG-
NET TRAIN work?


I just want to see
the MAGNET TRAIN...


The power of mag-
nets is awesome!


Hm... You've got
many GYM BADGES.


Just as I thought...
You're tough!


GYM BADGES give
you advantages in
battles.


It's locked...


The flyer's torn.

It's impossible to
read...




Hello, kiddo!

How would you like
some RAGECANDYBAR?

It's the thing to
eat in MAHOGANY!


Arrgh... You found
the secret stair-
way...


Heheh! The experi-
ment worked like a
charm.

MAGIKARP are just
worthless, but

GYARADOS are big
moneymakers.


Urrgh...

That guy's dragon
POKéMON are tough...


LANCE: DRAGONITE,
HYPER BEAM.


What took you,
{14}?

Just as I thought,
that strange radio

signal is coming
from here.


The stairs are
right here.


LANCE: {14}, we
should split up to

check this place.
I'll go first.




Hey!
Intruder alert!


Dang... I failed...


It's my turn!
There's no escape!


Surveillance cams
are in the POKéMON
statues.

We'll keep appear-
ing until you trip
a secret switch.


This was once a
ninja hideout.

There are traps to
confound intruders
like you.


I get it...


All right. I'll
divulge a secret
about our hideout.

That thing on the
floor up ahead is
a warp panel.

If you step on it,
you'll be warped

back to the en-
trance.


Heheh. Feeling
lucky, punk?

Go ahead, take
another step.

We've got traps
set in the floor!


Kaboom!


I don't even know
where the traps
are planted.

You'll just have
to collect your
courage and walk.


It's a PERSIAN
statue...

Its eyes are oddly
shiny.


A secret switch!
Better press it.


The switch is
turned off.




Hold it right
there!


We can't have a
brat like you on
the loose.

It's harmful to
TEAM ROCKET's
pride, you see.

However strong you
may be, you can't

take both of us at
the same time.

Sorry, baby. Now
get ready to be
thrashed.


Hey! Don't be so
selfish. Spread
the fun around.


What? You had an
accomplice?

Where is your
sense of honor?

As the interim
boss in place of

GIOVANNI, I'll
show you how wrong

it is to meddle
with TEAM ROCKET!


Tch, you really
are strong.

It's too bad.

If you were to
join TEAM ROCKET,

you could become
an EXECUTIVE.


...This hideout is
done for...

But that's fine.
The broadcast ex-
periment was a
total success.

It doesn't matter
what happens to
this hideout now.

We have much big-
ger plans.

You'll come to
appreciate TEAM

ROCKET's true
power soon enough.

Enjoy yourself
while you can...

Fufufufu...


LANCE: That did
it. We defeated

all the ROCKETS
here.

But I'm concerned
about the young

guy I battled in
the process...


Sorry, {14}.
I saw how well you

were doing, so I
just hung back.

Now all there is
left to do is to

turn off that odd
radio signal.


It's this machine
that's causing all
the problems.

I don't see a
switch on it...

We have no choice.
We have to make

all the ELECTRODE
faint.

That should stop
this machine from

transmitting that
strange signal.

It's no fault of
the POKéMON, so it

makes me feel
guilty.

{14}, let's
split the job.


LANCE: Leave this
side to me.


LANCE: That odd
signal has finally
stopped.

The LAKE should be
back to normal.

You're the hero!
Let me thank you

on behalf of all
the POKéMON.

Oh, yes. You
should take this.

I found it here,
but I don't have
any need for it.


{A1} received
HM06.


That's WHIRLPOOL.
Teach it to a

POKéMON to get
across wild water.

But keep this in
mind.

You can use that
out of battle only

with the BADGE
from MAHOGANY GYM.


{14}...

The journey to be-
coming the POKéMON

MASTER is long and
difficult.

Knowing that, will
you keep going?

...

I see. No, you're
right.

If you would give
up that easily,

you would have
never chased that

dream in the first
place.

I look forward to
seeing you again!


LANCE: Are you all
right?

Your POKéMON are
hurt and tired.

Here, give them
some of my medi-
cine.


LANCE: {14},
let's give it our
best for POKéMON.


The door won't
open?

Well, duh.
It has to have a

password that only
TEAM ROCKET knows.


What? I lost?


Heh, I'm just a
GRUNT.

I don't know the
password. Too bad
for you.


Oh, a kid? I don't
really like this,

but eliminate you
I must.


I knew I'd lose...


I got wiped out on
the last mission
by a kid too.

When we were ab-
ducting POKéMON,

this kid with long
red hair and mean-

looking eyes just
creamed me...


You rotten little
pest!


Grrrr...


Heh, only the boss
knows the password
for that door.

Where's the boss?
Who knows? Go look
for yourself.


The door's closed...

It needs a pass-
word to open.


The door's closed...

{A1} entered
the password.

The door opened!


It's the radio
transmitter that's

sending the
sinister signal.

It's working at
full capacity.


The radio trans-
mitter has finally

stopped its evil
broadcast.




LANCE: It takes
two passwords to

get into the
boss's quarters.

Those passwords
are known only to
a few ROCKETS.

That ROCKET there
very graciously
told me so.

{14}, let's go
get the passwords.


Urrggh... The guy
in the cape is
incredibly tough...


...

Didn't I tell you
that I was going

to destroy TEAM
ROCKET?

...Tell me, who was
the guy in the

cape who used
dragon POKéMON?

My POKéMON were no
match at all.

I don't care that
I lost. I can beat

him by getting
stronger POKéMON.

It's what he said
that bothers me...

He told me that
I don't love and

trust my POKéMON
enough.

I'm furious that I
lost to a bleeding
heart like him.

...Humph! I don't
have the time for
the likes of you!


What? Who are you?
This is the office

of our leader,
GIOVANNI.

Since disbanding
TEAM ROCKET three

years ago, he has
been in training.

But we're certain
he will be back

some day to assume
command again.

That's why we're
standing guard.

I won't let any-
one disturb this
place!


I... I couldn't do a
thing...

GIOVANNI, please
forgive me...


No, I can't let
this affect me.

I have to inform
the others...


MURKROW: The
password is...

HAIL GIOVANNI.


Do I know the
password?

Maybe.

But no weakling's
going to get it!


All right. Stop.
I'll tell you.


The password to
the boss's room is

SLOWPOKETAIL.

But it's useless
unless you have
two passwords.


Hyuck-hyuck-hyuck!

You're challenging
me to a battle?

Hah! You're nuts,
but you have guts!

I like that!

If you can beat
me, I'll tell you

a password to the
boss's room!


Hyuck-hyuck-hyuck!
You're good!


Hyuck-hyuck-hyuck!

The password to
the boss's room...

Uh..., I think it is
RATICATE TAIL.


I used to work for
SILPH, but now I

run research for
TEAM ROCKET.

A meddlesome child
like you needs to
be punished.


A mere tactical
error cost me...


A radio signal
that drives POKé-
MON mad...

My experiment is a
complete success.

My promotion is
assured. This loss

means absolutely
nothing.


I don't care that
POKéMON are hurt
by our experiment.


Thinking is my
strong suit, not
battling.


If we turn up the
power of our radio

signal for broad-
cast nationwide...

The very thought
excites me!


The door's closed...

It needs two
passwords to open.


The door's closed...

{A1} entered
the two passwords.

The door opened!




Oh, man... My boss
is going to be
steaming...

The FARFETCH'D
that CUTS trees

for charcoal took
off on me.

I can't go looking
for it here in the
ILEX FOREST.

It's too big, dark
and scary for me...


Wow! Thanks a
whole bunch!

My boss's POKéMON
won't obey me be-
cause I don't have
a BADGE.


It's the missing
POKéMON!


FARFETCH'D: Kwaa!


Ah! My FARFETCH'D!

You found it for
us, kid?

Without it, we
wouldn't be able

to CUT trees for
charcoal.

Thanks, kid!

Now, how can I
thank you...

I know! Here, take
this.


That's the CUT HM.
Teach that to a

POKéMON to clear
small trees.

Of course, you
have to have the

GYM BADGE from
AZALEA to use it.


Do you want to
apprentice as a

charcoal maker
with me?

You'll be first-
rate in ten years!


What am I doing?

I'm shaking trees
using HEADBUTT.

It's fun. Here,
you try it too!


Rattle trees with
HEADBUTT. Some-
times, sleeping
POKéMON fall out.


Did something
happen to the
forest's guardian?


ILEX FOREST is
so overgrown with

trees that you
can't see the sky.

Please watch out
for items that may
have been dropped.


ILEX FOREST
SHRINE...

It's in honor of
the forest's
protector...


ILEX FOREST
SHRINE...

It's in honor of
the forest's
protector...

Oh? What is this?

It's a hole.
It looks like the

GS BALL would fit
inside it.

Want to put the GS
BALL here?


{A1} put in the
GS BALL.


Whew, wasn't that
something!

{A1}, that was
fantastic. Thanks!

The legends about
that SHRINE were
real after all.

I feel inspired by
what I just saw.

It motivates me to
make better BALLS!

I'm going!


Don't sneak up on
me like that!

You frightened a
POKéMON away!


I hadn't seen that
POKéMON before...


A POKéMON I've
never seen before

fell out of the
tree when I used
HEADBUTT.

I ought to use
HEADBUTT in other
places too.




This lake is full
of GYARADOS but
nothing else...

So the MAGIKARP
are being forced
to evolve...


Did you come here
because of the
rumors?

You're {A1}?
I'm LANCE, a
trainer like you.

I heard some ru-
mors, so I came to
investigate...

I saw the way you
battled earlier,
{14}.

I can tell that
you're a trainer

with considerable
skill.

If you don't mind,
could you help me
investigate?


LANCE: Excellent!

It seems that the
LAKE's MAGIKARP

are being forced
to evolve.

A mysterious radio
broadcast coming

from MAHOGANY is
the cause.

I'll be waiting
for you, {14}.


Oh... Well, if you
change your mind,
please help me.


LANCE: Hm? Are you
going to help me?


GYARADOS: Gyashaa!


{A1} obtained a
RED SCALE.


The GYARADOS are
angry!

It's a bad omen!


Hahah! The MAGI-
KARP are biting!


I heard this lake
was made by ram-
paging GYARADOS.

I wonder if there
is any connection

to their mass out-
break now?


Did my eyes de-
ceive me? I saw a

red GYARADOS in
the LAKE...

But I thought
GYARADOS were
usually blue?


Let me battle with
the POKéMON I just
caught!


I might be an ex-
pert angler, but

I stink as a POKé-
MON trainer...


I won't lose as an
angler! I catch
POKéMON all day.


No matter what I
do, all I catch

are the same POKé-
MON...


My line's all
tangled up...


Why can't I catch
any good POKéMON?


If a trainer spots
another trainer,

he has to make a
challenge.

That is our
destiny.


Whew...
Good battle.


POKéMON and their
trainer become

powerful through
constant battling.


What happened to
the red GYARADOS?

It's gone?

Oh, darn. I came
here for nothing?

I know--let's
battle!


Good going!


Come to think of
it, I've seen a
pink BUTTERFREE.


WESLEY: Well, how
do you do?

Seeing as how it's
Wednesday today,

I'm WESLEY of
Wednesday.


Pleased to meet
you. Please take a
souvenir.


WESLEY: BLACKBELT
beefs up the power
of fighting moves.


WESLEY: Since you
found me, you must

have met my broth-
ers and sisters.

Or did you just
get lucky?


WESLEY: Today's
not Wednesday.
That's too bad.

will print out a
DIPLOMA for you.

You should go show
it off.


I'm the GRAPHIC
ARTIST.

I drew you!


I'm the GRAPHIC
ARTIST.

Oh, you completed
your POKéDEX?

Want me to print
out your DIPLOMA?


Give me a shout if
you want your
DIPLOMA printed.


Something's wrong.
I'll have to can-
cel printing.


Who, me? I'm the
PROGRAMMER.

Play the slot
machines!


Aren't the TWINS
adorable?

JASMINE's pretty
too.

Oh, I love them!


GAME FREAK
DEVELOPMENT ROOM


It's a detailed
drawing of a
pretty girl.


It's the game
program. Messing

with it could put
a bug in the game!


It's crammed with
reference materi-
als. There's even
a POKé DOLL.




High places--I do
love them so!

I'd say the only
thing that loves

heights as much as
me is smoke!


There's graffiti
on the wall...

{A1} added a
moustache!




Let me recount a
terrifying tale...


Then again, it's
not as scary while

it's still light
outside.

Come back after
sunset, OK?


Once upon a time,
there was a little

boy who was given
a new BICYCLE...

He wanted to try
it right away...

He was having so
much fun that he

didn't notice the
sun had set...

While riding home
in the pitch-black

night, the bike
suddenly slowed!

The pedals became
heavy!

When he stopped
pedaling, the bike

began slipping
backwards!

It was as if the
bike were cursed

and trying to drag
him into oblivion!

...

...

SHRIEEEEK!

The boy had been
riding uphill on
CYCLING ROAD!

...
Ba-dum ba-dum!

For listening so
patiently, you may
take this--TM03!


TM03 is CURSE.

It's a terrifying
move that slowly

whittles down the
victim's HP.




ERIKA is a master
of grass POKéMON.

She'll make you
pay if you don't
watch yourself.


TEAM ROCKET's
hideout is in the

basement of the
GAME CORNER.

Oh, wait. That was
three years ago.


EUSINE: Hi!

I'm back visiting
my hometown.

It's been quite a
while.


{A1}, have you
heard?

There have been
fresh rumors of a

rainbow-colored
POKéMON appearing
at TIN TOWER.

I've just had my
party healed, so

now I'm headed to
ECRUTEAK.

I'll be seeing
you, {A1}!


Oh, by the way,
{A1}.

Have you caught
the legendary

POKéMON RAIKOU and
ENTEI?

..................

Okay...

If you catch even
one, I hope that
you'll inform me.

I'm counting on
you, {A1}!

It's this machine

It cleaned me out

I think this slot

out...

The odds vary
among machines.


Gahahaha!

The coins just
keep popping out!

Hm? What, kid? You
want to play?

I'll share my luck
with you!


Gahahaha!

It makes me feel
good to do nice

people!


Hey, you don't
have a COIN CASE.

How am I supposed
to give you any
coins, kid?


Hey, your COIN
CASE is full, kid.

You must be riding
a winning streak
too.


Hey! CHAMP in
making!

Are you playing
the slots too?

I'm trying to get
enough coins for a
prize POKéMON.

But I don't have
enough coins yet...


Hmmm... The odds are
surely better for

PIKACHU's line,
but... What to do?


Hey!

Underneath this

There's nothing!


Hey!

ERIKA: Hello...
Lovely weather,

isn't it?
It's so pleasant...

...I'm afraid I may
doze off...

My name is ERIKA.
I am the LEADER of
CELADON GYM.

...Oh? All the way
from JOHTO, you
say? How nice...

Oh. I'm sorry, I
didn't realize

that you wished to
challenge me.

Very well, but I
shall not lose.


ERIKA: Oh!
I concede defeat...
You are remarkably
strong...

I shall give you
RAINBOWBADGE...


{A1} received
RAINBOWBADGE.


ERIKA: That was a
delightful match.

I felt inspired.
Please, I wish you
to have this TM.

It is GIGA DRAIN.

It is a wonderful
move that drains

half the damage it
inflicts to heal
your POKéMON.

Please use it if
it pleases you...


ERIKA: Losing
leaves a bitter
aftertaste...

But knowing that
there are strong

trainers spurs me
to do better...


Do you think a
girls-only GYM
is rare?


Oh, bleah!


I just got care-
less, that's all!


Oh, a battle?
That's kind of
scary, but OK!


Oh, that's it?


Oh, look at all
your BADGES. No

wonder I couldn't
win!


Were you looking
at these flowers
or at me?


How annoying!


How do I go about
becoming ladylike
like ERIKA?


We'll show you
POKéMON moves that
ERIKA taught us!


Oh... We lost...


ERIKA will get you
back for us!


We're going to
protect ERIKA!


We couldn't win...


ERIKA is much,
much stronger!




Hi!

We're holding an
eatathon contest.

We can't serve you
right now. Sorry.


...Snarfle, chew...


Don't talk to me!

You'll break my
concentration!


...Gulp... Chew...


I take quantity
over quality!

I'm happy when I'm
full!


Munch, munch...


The food is good
here, but GOLDEN-
ROD has the best
food anywhere.


Crunch... Crunch...


Nobody here will
give you a COIN

CASE. You should
look in JOHTO.


Crunch... Crunch...

I can keep eating!


More, CHEF!


Eatathon Contest!
No time limit!

A battle without
end! The biggest

muncher gets it
all for free!


{A1} found
!


But {A1} can't
hold another item...




If you cruise down
CYCLING ROAD, you

will end up in
FUCHSIA CITY.




CYCLING ROAD
starts here.

It's all downhill,
so it's totally
exhilarating.

It's a great sort
of feeling that

you can't get from
a ship or train.


Hey! Whoa! Stop!

You can't go out
on the CYCLING

ROAD without a
BICYCLE.




Did you hear about
the accident at
the POWER PLANT?

It's located in
the East, close to
LAVENDER TOWN.


I take my GUARD
job seriously.

Hey! You have a
POKéDEX.

OK. You can go
through.




CYCLING ROAD
Uphill Starts Here


Hang on! Don't you
have a BICYCLE?

The CYCLING ROAD
is beyond here.

You have to have a
BICYCLE to go on.




A bunch of DIGLETT
popped out of the

ground! That was
shocking.




...... ...... ......

It's been a while,
{A1}.

...Since I lost to
you, I thought

about what I was
lacking with my
POKéMON...

And we came up
with an answer.

{A1}, now we'll
show you!


...... ...... ......

I thought I raised
my POKéMON to be

the best they
could be...

...But it still 
wasn't enough...


...... ...... ......

...You won, fair
and square.

I admit it. But
this isn't the
end.

I'm going to be
the greatest POKé-
MON trainer ever.

Because these guys
are behind me.

...Listen, {A1}.

One of these days
I'm going to prove

how good I am by
beating you.


...... ...... ......

I've repaid my
debt to you.

With my POKéMON,
I'm going to beat

the CHAMPION and
become the world's
greatest trainer.



Hold it.

...Are you going to
take the POKéMON
LEAGUE challenge?

...Don't make me
laugh.

You're so much
weaker than I am.

I'm not like I was
before.

I now have the
best and strongest

POKéMON with me.
I'm invincible!

{A1}!
I challenge you!


...I couldn't win...

I gave it every-
thing I had...

What you possess,
and what I lack...

I'm beginning to
understand what

that dragon master
said to me...


...I haven't given up
on becoming the
greatest trainer...

I'm going to find
out why I can't

win and become
stronger...

When I do, I will
challenge you.

And I'll beat you
down with all my
power.

...Humph! You keep
at it until then.


...Humph!

When it comes down
to it, nothing can
beat power.

I don't need any-
thing else.



We're departing
soon. Please get
on board.


Sorry. You can't
board now.


Welcome to FAST
SHIP S.S.AQUA.

Will you be board-
ing today?


May I see your
S.S.TICKET?


We hope to see you
again!


{A1} flashed
the S.S.TICKET.

That's it.
Thank you!


{A1} tried to
show the S.S.
TICKET...

...But no TICKET!

Sorry!
You may board only

if you have an
S.S.TICKET.


The FAST SHIP will
sail next Monday.


The FAST SHIP will
sail next Friday.


SHELLDER are easy
to catch here.

They're kind of
rare elsewhere.


How many RODS do
you have?

Different RODS
catch different
POKéMON.


S.S.AQUA uses jets
to skim over the
waves!


There are lots of
POKéMON in KANTO.

I wish I could go...


We don't want you
to fall into the

sea, so you're not
allowed in.




We're departing

You came from

I hear many rare
POKéMON live over
there.




FAST SHIP S.S.AQUA
is en route to
VERMILION CITY.

We will make an
announcement when
we arrive.


FAST SHIP S.S.AQUA
is en route to
OLIVINE CITY.

We will make an
announcement when
we arrive.


Here's your cabin.

If your POKéMON
are hurt, take a
nap in the bed.

That will heal
them.


Here's your cabin.

You can heal your
POKéMON by taking
a nap in the bed.

The ship will
arrive while
you're sleeping.


The passengers are
all trainers.

They're all itch-
ing to battle in
their cabins.


Whoa! Excuse me.
I was in a hurry!

My granddaughter
is missing!

She's just a wee
girl. If you see

her, please let me
know!


FAST SHIP S.S.AQUA
has arrived in
OLIVINE CITY.


FAST SHIP S.S.AQUA
has arrived in
VERMILION CITY.




I'm going to KANTO
to test my skills.


I wanted to win!


Trainers from
JOHTO can battle

with KANTO GYM
LEADERS.


I'm training to
become the CHAMP!


What's so differ-
ent between us?


I'm going to beat
you someday!


Do you know LILY?
She's a hot DJ in
KANTO.


Gyaaaah!


LILY's nice, but
MARY's the best!

I want to check
out JOHTO's radio
programs!


Are you alone?
Then let's battle!


That's too much to
handle!


I wonder if there
are any mountains

worth climbing in
KANTO?


Yeah, I'm a sail-
or, all right.

I wasn't goofing
off!

This cabin was
vacant, so I just
took a quick nap!

Ah, forget it!
Let's battle!


Sorry! It's all my
fault!


Being a sailor, I
have to do phys-
ical labor. It's
exhausting!


Oh, no. I've lost
something that's
very important.


I... I can't find
it...


I give up.
You don't have to

look. Just forget
about it!


Yeehaw!
Lucky!


How unlucky!
I lost!


I found a pretty
coin here.

Someone must have
lost it...




I'm going to KANTO
to put on fire-
breathing shows!


Fizzle... The
flame's tiny...


I guess fire is
weak on the sea.

It doesn't matter?
Really?


I'm visiting my
grandma to catch
me some bugs!


Ooh, wow.
You're tough!


You can find lots
of POKéMON in the
trees of JOHTO!


I'm trying to
forget my woes.
Let's battle!


My heart weeps...


A voyage is best
for getting over
a broken heart.

But a FAST SHIP
trip is too short
for grieving.


I'm going to audi-
tion my songs at

GOLDENROD's RADIO
STATION.


Yowza!
Total distortion!


I was going to
make my debut at
the BATTLE TOWER...

I should go back
to VERMILION and
redo my training...


Speaking of the
RADIO STATION,

what's this week's
lucky number?


A comfy bed!
Time to sleep...


Ah, refreshed and
restored!


FAST SHIP S.S.AQUA
has arrived in
OLIVINE CITY.


FAST SHIP S.S.AQUA
has arrived in
VERMILION CITY.




Whew! Thanks for
coming along.

Keeping that lit-
tle girl amused
was exhausting.


How do you like
S.S.AQUA's ride?

She practically
skates across the
waves.


Oh, hello...

I still can't find
my granddaughter.

If she's on the
ship, that's OK.

She's an energetic
child, so she may

be bugging some-
one. I'm worried...


{14}, was it?
I heard you enter-
tained my grand-
daughter.

I want to thank
you for that.


I know! I'd like
you to have this!


We're traveling
around the world.


CAPTAIN, play with
me, please?

I'm bored! I want
to play more!


Hi! Will you play
with me?

...Oh!

Grandpa's worried
about me?

I have to go!

I have to go find
Grandpa!


Grandpa, here I
am! I was playing

with the CAPTAIN
and this guy!


Grandpa, here I
am! I was playing

with the CAPTAIN
and this big girl!


I had lots of fun
playing!


Hey, kid! Want to
battle with me?


You're strong!


You're traveling
all alone?

Isn't your mom
worried?


You think I'm a
baby?
That's not fair!


Oh! We lost!


Baby is a rude
name to call us
girls!


I'm not a baby!

That's not nice to
say to a lady!


Oh! We lost!


Sometimes, kids
are smarter than
grown-ups!


Ssh! My brain is
picking up radio
signals!


...I hear some-
thing!


I get it. You can
hear JOHTO's radio
on the FAST SHIP.


What do you think?
My POKéMON are
beautiful, yes?


Oh, no! My beauti-
ful POKéMON!


I must go to the
POKéMON SALON and
fix them up nice!


I'm going to shop
at the DEPT.STORE
and then...


What was I going
to do?


Oh, yes! I have to
get my POKéMON out
of DAY-CARE!


What kinds of POKé
BALLS do you have
with you?


Wait! Stop! Don't!
Please!


You should use the
right BALLS to fit
the situation.


FAST SHIP S.S.AQUA
has arrived in
VERMILION CITY.




Hey, kid. Could I
get you to look
for my buddy?

He's goofing off
somewhere, that
lazy bum!

I want to go find
him, but I'm on
duty right now.


Oh, gee...

The CAPTAIN will
be furious...


Thanks, kid!
I chewed him out

good so he'll quit
slacking off!


A little girl?

I may have seen
her go by here.


The dining room is
up ahead.

The stairs at the
end lead to the
CAPTAIN's cabin.


Nothing beats a
battle when I'm
on my break.


Win or lose, my
break's over!


I guess I can't
win if I don't get
serious.


I'm so bored.
Want to battle?


Yow! You're too
strong!


SAFFRON, CELADON...
I hear there are

many big cities
in KANTO.


Urrf...
I'm seasick!


I can't move any-
more...


No more ships for
me. Next time,

I'm taking the
MAGNET TRAIN.


This is where we
sailors work!


I lost on my home
field...


We get different
passengers from

VERMILION CITY to
OLIVINE CITY.


Even though we're
out on the sea, I
can't fish!

This is boring!
Let's battle!


I... I'm not bored
anymore...


I plan to fish off
VERMILION's pier.


I'm building up my
legs by bracing

against the ship's
rocking!


Rocked and rolled
over!


I couldn't find
the KARATE KING in
JOHTO.

He's supposed to
be training in a
cave somewhere.


I'm a sailor man!

But I'm training
POKéMON, so I can
become the CHAMP!


My lack of train-
ing is obvious...


Eight BADGES!
They must prove

that you've beaten
GYM LEADERS.

No wonder you're
so good!


Don't lay a finger
on my students!


Aaack!


We're on a field
trip to the RUINS
outside VIOLET.


Do you know the
RUINS OF ALPH?


Yaargh!


Radios pick up
strange signals
inside the RUINS.


There are some odd
stone panels in
the RUINS OF ALPH.


I was done in!


I read that there
are four of those
stone panels.

Mondays and Fri-
days.

MT.MOON SQUARE
DON'T LITTER




When the sun goes
down, CLEFAIRY
come out to play.




Shaoooh!




This is where I do
my training!


Beaten by a
passing stranger!


Have you been to
GOLDENROD CITY?

Weren't you amazed
by how they've

changed the
POKéMON CENTER?


I'm going to train
even harder.

After all, I'm
trying to become
a GYM LEADER.


I'm the best in my
class at POKéMON.


No! There are bet-
ter trainers...


I'm trying hard so
I can be the star
in my class.


I'm confident in
my ability to
raise POKéMON.

Want to see?


Did I screw up my
training?


Maybe I should
take one to a DAY-

CARE. Or maybe use
some items...


Shopping under the
sky!

It feels so nice
up on a rooftop.


Are you a trainer?

Let's have a
practice battle.


Oh, no! I just
can't win...


You're too strong
to be a practice
partner.


Who goes there?
What are you up
to?


You're a tough
little kid.


Yep, I see nothing
wrong today. You

be good and stay
out of trouble.


I'm on patrol for
suspicious indi-
viduals.


I just got my
POKéMON back from
DAY-CARE.

Let's see how much
stronger it got!


Why does it end
this way?


My POKéMON knew
moves I didn't
know it had.

That confounded me
to no end!


IRENE: Kyaaah!
Someone found us!


IRENE: Ohhh!
Too strong!


IRENE: My sister
KATE will get you
for this!


IRENE: Isn't this
beach great?

It's our secret
little getaway!


JENN: You can't
beat IRENE and go
unpunished!


JENN: So sorry,
IRENE! Sis!


JENN: Don't get
cocky! My sister
KATE is tough!


JENN: Sunlight
makes your body
stronger.


KATE: You sure
were mean to my
little sisters!


KATE: No! I can't
believe I lost.


KATE: You're too
strong. I didn't
stand a chance.

Here. You deserve
this.


KATE: I'm sorry we
jumped you.

We never expected
anyone to find us

here. You sure
startled us.

LET US RAISE YOUR
POKéMON FOR YOU!




ELM: {14}!
There you are!

I needed to ask
you a favor.

I'm conducting new
POKéMON research

right now. I was
wondering if you

could help me with
it, {14}.

You see...

I'm writing a
paper that I want

to present at a
conference.

But there are some
things I don't

quite understand
yet.

So!

I'd like you to
raise a POKéMON

that I recently
caught.


Thanks, {14}!

You're a great
help!


But... Please, I
need your help!


When I announce my
findings, I'm sure

we'll delve a bit
deeper into the

many mysteries of
POKéMON.

You can count on
it!


Oh, hey! I got an
e-mail!

..................
Hm... Uh-huh...

Okay...


Hey, listen.

I have an acquain-
tance called MR.
POKéMON.

He keeps finding
weird things and

raving about his
discoveries.

Anyway, I just got
an e-mail from him

saying that this
time it's real.

It is intriguing,
but we're busy

with our POKéMON
research...

Wait!

I know!

{14}, can you
go in our place?


I want you to
raise one of the

POKéMON contained
in these BALLS.

You'll be that
POKéMON's first
partner, {14}!

Go on. Pick one!


If a wild POKéMON
appears, let your
POKéMON battle it!


ELM: Wait! Where
are you going?


ELM: You'll take
CYNDAQUIL, the
fire POKéMON?


ELM: Do you want
TOTODILE, the
water POKéMON?


ELM: So, you like
CHIKORITA, the
grass POKéMON?


ELM: Think it over
carefully.

Your partner is
important.


ELM: I think
that's a great
POKéMON too!


{A1} received
!


MR.POKéMON lives a
little bit beyond

CHERRYGROVE, the
next city over.

It's almost a
direct route

there, so you
can't miss it.

But just in case,
here's my phone

number. Call me if
anything comes up!


If your POKéMON is
hurt, you should

heal it with this
machine.

Feel free to use
it anytime.


{14}, I'm
counting on you!


{A1} got ELM's
phone number.


MR.POKéMON goes
everywhere and
finds rarities.

Too bad they're
just rare and
not very useful...


It contains a
POKéMON caught by
PROF.ELM.


I wonder what this
does?


Would you like to
heal your POKéMON?


ELM: {14}, this
is terrible...

Oh, yes, what was
MR.POKéMON's big
discovery?


{A1} handed
the MYSTERY EGG to
PROF.ELM.


ELM: This?


But... Is it a
POKéMON EGG?

If it is, it is a
great discovery!


ELM: What?!?

PROF.OAK gave you
a POKéDEX?

{14}, is that
true? Th-that's
incredible!

He is superb at
seeing the poten-
tial of people as
trainers.

Wow, {14}. You
may have what it

takes to become
the CHAMPION.

You seem to be
getting on great
with POKéMON too.

You should take
the POKéMON GYM
challenge.

The closest GYM
would be the one
in VIOLET CITY.


...{14}. The
road to the

championship will
be a long one.

Before you leave,
make sure that you
talk to your mom.


ELM: Don't give
up! I'll call if

I learn anything
about that EGG!


ELM: {14}?
Didn't you meet my
assistant?

He should have met
you with the EGG

at VIOLET CITY's
POKéMON CENTER.

You must have just
missed him. Try to
catch him there.


ELM: Hey, has that
EGG changed any?


{14}? I thought
the EGG hatched.

Where is the
POKéMON?


ELM: {14}, you
look great!


What?
That POKéMON!?!


The EGG hatched!
So, POKéMON are
born from EGGS...

No, perhaps not
all POKéMON are.

Wow, there's still
a lot of research
to be done.


Thanks, {14}!
You're helping

unravel POKéMON
mysteries for us!

I want you to have
this as a token of
our appreciation.


That's an
EVERSTONE.

Some species of
POKéMON evolve

when they grow to
certain levels.

A POKéMON holding
the EVERSTONE
won't evolve.

Give it to a POKé-
MON you don't want
to evolve.


ELM: {14}, I'll
call you if any-
thing comes up.


...sigh... That
stolen POKéMON.

I wonder how it's
doing.

They say a POKéMON
raised by a bad

person turns bad
itself.


ELM: Hi, {14}!
Thanks to you, my

research is going
great!

Take this as a
token of my
appreciation.


The MASTER BALL is
the best!

It's the ultimate
BALL! It'll catch

any POKéMON with-
out fail.

It's given only to
recognized POKéMON
researchers.

I think you can
make much better

use of it than I
can, {14}!


ELM: {14}!
There you are!

I called because I
have something for
you.

See? It's an
S.S.TICKET.

Now you can catch
POKéMON in KANTO.


The ship departs
from OLIVINE CITY.

But you knew that
already, {14}.

After all, you've
traveled all over
with your POKéMON.

Give my regards to
PROF.OAK in KANTO!


It's the POKéMON
EGG being studied
by PROF.ELM.


{14}, I want
you to have this
for your errand.


There are only two
of us, so we're
always busy.


There was a loud
noise outside...

When we went to
look, someone
stole a POKéMON.

It's unbelievable
that anyone would
do that!

...sigh... That
stolen POKéMON.

I wonder how it's
doing.

They say a POKéMON
raised by a bad

person turns bad
itself.


{14}!

Use these on your
POKéDEX quest!


To add to your
POKéDEX, you have
to catch POKéMON.

Throw POKé BALLS
at wild POKéMON
to get them.


I heard a POKéMON
was stolen here...

I was just getting
some information
from PROF.ELM.

Apparently, it was
a young male with
long, red hair...

What?

You battled a
trainer like that?

Did you happen to
get his name?


OK! So {A2}
was his name.

Thanks for helping
my investigation!


The window's open.

OBSERVATIONS ON
POKéMON EVOLUTION

...It says on the
screen...




POKéGEAR



Oh, {A1}...! Our
neighbor, PROF.

ELM, was looking
for you.

He said he wanted
you to do some-
thing for him.

Oh! I almost for-
got! Your POKéMON

GEAR is back from
the repair shop.

Here you go!


POKéMON GEAR, or
just POKéGEAR.

It's essential if
you want to be a
good trainer.

Oh, the day of the
week isn't set.

You mustn't forget
that!


Is it Daylight
Saving Time now?


Come home to
adjust your clock

for Daylight
Saving Time.

By the way, do you
know how to use
the PHONE?


Don't you just
turn the POKéGEAR

on and select the
PHONE icon?


I'll read the
instructions.

Turn the POKéGEAR
on and select the
PHONE icon.


Phone numbers are
stored in memory.

Just choose a name
you want to call.

Gee, isn't that
convenient?


PROF.ELM is wait-
ing for you.

Hurry up, baby!


So, what was PROF.
ELM's errand?

...

That does sound
challenging.

But, you should be
proud that people
rely on you.


{A1}, do it!

I'm behind you all
the way!


Good morning,
{14}!

I'm visiting!


Hello, {14}!
I'm visiting!


Good evening,
{14}!

I'm visiting!


{14}, have you
heard?

My daughter is
adamant about

becoming PROF.
ELM's assistant.

She really loves
POKéMON!


Mom's specialty!

Let's see what's

FRESH WATER and
tasty LEMONADE!

I'd better get

PIKACHU is an

I was amazed by

He's so famous for
his research on
POKéMON evolution.

I wish I could be
a researcher like
him...

Hi, {14}! My
husband's always

so busy--I hope
he's OK.

When he's caught
up in his POKéMON

research, he even
forgets to eat.


When I grow up,
I'm going to help
my dad!

I'm going to be a
great POKéMON
professor!


There's some food
here. It must be
for the LAB.


There's some food
here. This must be
for POKéMON.


POKéMON. Where do
they come from? 

Where are they
going?

Why has no one
ever witnessed a
POKéMON's birth?

I want to know! I
will dedicate my

life to the study
of POKéMON!

...

It's a part of
PROF.ELM's re-
search papers.




Your POKéMON look
a little tired.

You should rest
them a while.


There!

Your POKéMON are
looking good!

Keep at it!




There's something
written here.

Read it?


To my brothers and
sisters:

We take pride in
serving POKéMON
trainers.

When trainers talk
to you, give them
something useful.

Love,

Where are you off
to with POKéMON?

POKéMON LEAGUE?

Are your POKéMON
loyal enough for
you to win?

Let me see...


Ah! Your POKéMON
trusts you very
much.

It's nice to see a
good trainer.

Here. A gift for
your journey.


TM37 happens to be
SANDSTORM.

It's a move that
inflicts damage on
both battlers.

It's for advanced
trainers only.

Use it if you
dare. Good luck!


If it doesn't come
to trust you some

more, it could be
tough going.

Trust is the tie
that binds POKéMON
and trainers.




You can't climb
ledges.

But you can jump
down from them to
take a shortcut.


Different kinds of
POKéMON appear
past here.

If you want to
catch them all,

you have to look
everywhere.




POKéMON LEAGUE

VICTORY ROAD
ENTRANCE




I got booted out
of the GAME COR-
NER.

I was trying to
cheat using my
POKéMON...


...Grumble...


I guess I have to
do things fair and
square...


Do you consider
type alignments in
battle?

If you know your
type advantages,

you'll do better
in battle.


Ow, ow, ow!


I know my POKéMON
type alignments.

But I only use one
type of POKéMON.


My POKéMON just
got a haircut!

I'll show you how
strong it is!


Aiyeeee!


Your POKéMON will
like you more if

you give them
haircuts.


I think you have
some rare POKéMON
with you.

Let me see them!


Gaah! I lost!
That makes me mad!


Are you making a
POKéDEX? Here's a
hot tip.

The HIKER on ROUTE
33, ANTHONY, is a
good guy.

He'll phone you if
he sees any rare
POKéMON.


The door's locked...


The door is open.


The BASEMENT KEY
opened the door.


Welcome!

I run the POKéMON
SALON!

I'm the older and
better of the two
HAIRCUT BROTHERS.

I can make your
POKéMON beautiful
for just ¥500.

Would you like me
to do that?


Which POKéMON
should I work on?


OK! Watch it
become beautiful!


There! All done!


Is that right?
That's a shame!


You'll need more
money than that.


I do only one
haircut a day. I'm
done for today.


Welcome to the
POKéMON SALON!

I'm the younger
and less expen-
sive of the two
HAIRCUT BROTHERS.

I'll spiff up your
POKéMON for just
¥300.

So? How about it?


OK, which POKéMON
should I do?


OK! I'll make it
look cool!


There we go!
All done!


No? 
How disappointing!


You're a little
short on funds.


I can do only one
haircut a day.

Sorry, but I'm all
done for today.

little happier.

NO ENTRY BEYOND
THIS POINT




Hold it!

I saw you, so I
tailed you.

I don't need you
underfoot while I

take care of TEAM
ROCKET.

...Wait a second.
You beat me be-
fore, didn't you?

That was just a
fluke.

But I repay my
debts!


...Why...
Why do I lose?

I've assembled the
toughest POKéMON.

I didn't ease up
on the gas.

So why do I lose?


...I don't under-
stand...

Is what that LANCE
guy said true?

That I don't treat
POKéMON properly?

Love...

Trust...

Are they really
what I lack?

Are they keeping
me from winning?

I... I just don't
understand.

But it's not going
to end here.

Not now. Not
because of this.

I won't give up my
dream of becoming

the world's best
POKéMON trainer!


Humph. This is my
real power, wimp.

I'll make TEAM
ROCKET history.

And I'm going to
grind that LANCE
under my heels.



I was challenged
to a battle down-
stairs.

It's rough down
there. You'd
better be careful.


There are some
shops downstairs...

But there are
also trainers.

I'm scared to go
down there.


Open one shutter,
another closes.

Bet you can't get
where you want!


Drat! I was sunk
by indecision!


I'm confused too...
The switch on the

end is the one to
press first, but...


Kwahaha!

Confounded by the
shutters, are we?

I'll let you in on
a secret if you
can beat me!


Uwww...
I blew it.


All right. A hint!

Change the order
of switching.

That'll change the
ways the shutters
open and close.


Fork over your
goodies!


Mercy!


Steal and sell!
That's basic in
crime, kid!


They ditched this
project before
they finished.

I'm searching for
leftover loot.


Over the top!


UNDERGROUND WARE-
HOUSE?

What do you want
to go there for?

There's nothing
down there.


I don't care if
you're lost.

You show up here,
you're nothing but
a victim!


Urk! Yeah, think
you're cool, huh?


You must have ice
in your veins to
dis TEAM ROCKET.


It's labeled
SWITCH 1.


Are you lost? No,
you can't be.

You don't have
that scared look.

I'll give you
something to be
scared about!


How could you?


Go wherever you'd
like! Get lost!
See if I care!


It's OFF.
Turn it ON?


It's ON.
Turn it OFF?


It's labeled
SWITCH 2.


It's labeled
SWITCH 3.


It's labeled
EMERGENCY.




Hey, kid! You're
holding us up!

Our policy is to
work behind the

scenes where no
one can see us!


I lose my passion
for work if some-
one's watching.

Come on, kid,
scoot!


Oohah! Oohah!

The stuff on the
ground's junk.

Take it if you
want it!


MACHOKE: Maaacho!




How did you get
this far?

I guess it can't
be helped. I'll
dispose of you.


I got disposed of...


TEAM ROCKET will
keep going, wait-
ing for the return
of GIOVANNI.

We'll do whatever
it takes.


You're not going
any farther!

I don't show mercy
to my enemies, not
even brats!


Blast it!


I lost...

Please forgive me,
GIOVANNI!


Hyuck-hyuck-hyuck!
I remember you!

You got me good
at our hideout!


Hyuck-hyuck-hyuck!
So, that's how?


Hyuck-hyuck-hyuck!
That was a blast!
I'll remember you!


DIRECTOR: Who?
What? You came to
rescue me?

Thank you!

The RADIO TOWER!

What's happening
there?

Taken over by TEAM
ROCKET?

Here. Take this
CARD KEY.


DIRECTOR: Use that
to open the shut-
ters on 3F.


I'm begging you to
help.

There's no telling
what they'll do if

they control the
transmitter.

They may even be
able to control

POKéMON using a
special signal!

You're the only
one I can call on.

Please save the
RADIO TOWER...

And all the POKé-
MON nationwide!




I'm not losing
this time!


I lost to some
kid...?


A while back, this
karate dude wanted

to battle. He was
ridiculously good.

He just thrashed
us silly.

He went in deeper
saying it was for

his training. I
wonder how he is?


Hey! HUGH!


I mistook you for
someone else...


I came to explore
MT.MORTAR, but I

got separated from
my partner...

Did you run into a
trainer who uses a

SEADRA that knows
WATERFALL?




Yo! MARKUS!


Sorry, my mistake.


I'm investigating
MT.MORTAR, but my
pal's gone AWOL.

Have you seen a
trainer who has a

SLOWPOKE that can
use STRENGTH?




Hey!

I am the KARATE
KING!

I train alone here
in the dark!

You!
Battle with me!

Hwaaarggh!


Waaaarggh!
I'm beaten!


I... I'm crushed...

My training is
still not enough...

But a loss is a
loss. I admit it.

As proof that you
defeated me, I'll

give you a rare
fighting POKéMON.


{A1} received
TYROGUE.


TYROGUE is a
fighting-type.

It evolves into a
tougher POKéMON.

Keep up the hard
work. I'll keep
training too.

Farewell!


You have no room
in your party!




The boulder fell
through.




It's immovably
imbedded in ice.




To the north of
LAVENDER is ROCK

TUNNEL. Go through
it to get to the
POWER PLANT.


There's a radio
program that plays
POKé FLUTE music.

Oh? Ah, your radio
needs an EXPN CARD
to tune into it.


If the POWER PLANT
isn't running, the

MAGNET TRAIN won't
run either...

It also means the
RADIO STATION
can't broadcast...


The DIRECTOR of
the RADIO STATION
sure was happy.

He said they're
back on the air

because the POWER
PLANT is running
smoothly again.




MR.FUJI does live
here, but he's not

home now.

He should be at
the SOUL HOUSE.


Some cold-hearted
people stop caring
for their POKéMON.

Grandpa takes in
the poor homeless

POKéMON and takes
care of them.


PSYDUCK: Gu-guwa?


NIDORINO: Gyun!


PIDGEY: Pijji!




LAVENDER is a
tiny, quiet town

at the foot of the
mountains.

It's gotten a bit
busier since the

RADIO TOWER was
built.




REPEL is a neces-
sity if you are

going to explore a
cave.

Even though I like
exploring, I still

haven't made it to
all the caves.


I heard about a
craftsman who

makes custom BALLS
in the JOHTO town

of AZALEA. I wish
I had some.




MR.FUJI: Welcome.

Hmm... You appear to
be raising your

POKéMON in a kind
and loving manner.

POKéMON lovers
come here to pay

their respects to
departed POKéMON.

Please offer con-
dolences for the

souls of the de-
parted POKéMON.

I'm sure that will
make them happy.


There are other
graves of POKéMON
here, I think.

There are many
chambers that only
MR.FUJI may enter.


I came with my mom
to visit POKéMON
graves...


The POKéMON that
lived with me...

I loved them like
my grandchildren...




EXPN CARD



Welcome!
Feel free to look

around anywhere on
this floor.


Sorry, but you can
only tour the
ground floor.

Ever since JOHTO's
RADIO TOWER was

taken over by a
criminal gang, we

have had to step
up our security.


Many people are
hard at work here

in the RADIO
TOWER.

They must be doing
their best to put
on good shows.


Oh, no, no, no!

We've been off the
air ever since the

POWER PLANT shut
down.

All my efforts to
start this station

would be wasted if
I can't broadcast.

I'll be ruined!


Ah! So you're the
{14} who solved

the POWER PLANT's
problem?

Thanks to you, I
never lost my job.

I tell you, you're
a real lifesaver!

Please take this
as my thanks.


With that thing,
you can tune into

the radio programs
here in KANTO.

Gahahahaha!


Hey there!

I am the super
MUSIC DIRECTOR!

Huh? Your POKéGEAR
can't tune into my

music programs.
How unfortunate!

If you get an EXPN

better get one!

TIN TOWER is off
limits to anyone

without ECRUTEAK
GYM's BADGE.

Sorry, but you'll
have to leave.


TIN TOWER is off
limits to anyone

without ECRUTEAK
GYM's BADGE.

Ah!

ECRUTEAK's GYM
BADGE! Please, go
right through.


A momentous event
has occurred.

I beg your pardon,
but I must ask you
to leave.

...What soothes the
soul...

The WISE TRIO say
things that are so

very difficult to
understand...


A momentous event
has occurred.

I beg your pardon,
but I must ask you
to leave.

..................

Ah!

The sound of that
CLEAR BELL!

It... It's sublime!

I've never heard
so beautiful a
sound before!

That bell's chime
is indicative of
the bearer's soul.

You...

You may be able to
make it through
TIN TOWER.

Please, do go on.


Please, do go on.


That bell's chime
is indicative of
the bearer's soul.

You...

You may be able to
make it through
TIN TOWER.

Please, do go on.


The TIN TOWER
ahead is a nine-

tier tower of
divine beauty.

It soothes the
soul of all who
see it.


The TIN TOWER
shook! A POKéMON

must have returned
to the top!


Two towers...
Two POKéMON...

But when one
burned down, both

POKéMON flew away,
never to return.




Astounding...

SUICUNE, ENTEI and
RAIKOU have arisen
from their sleep...

Is the legend
coming true?


We train at the
BURNED TOWER, but

we've never heard
of a hole opening

up there before.
It must have been

deliberately made
by someone.


TIN TOWER may be
entered by those

bearing ECRUTEAK's
GYM BADGE.

However, now that
SUICUNE, RAIKOU

and ENTEI have
arisen, I ask you

to refrain from
entering!


We, the WISE TRIO,
are the protectors

of the legendary
POKéMON.


Legend has it that
upon the emergence

of a trainer who
has the ability to

touch the souls of
POKéMON, a POKéMON

will come forth to
put that trainer

to test at the TIN
TOWER.

The legend has
come true!

The legendary
POKéMON SUICUNE
has arrived!

We, the WISE TRIO,
shall test your

worthiness to go
inside!


Stronger than we
thought? Perhaps...


Ah, so it is you
who claim to have

seen SUICUNE,
ENTEI and RAIKOU
while they slept?

Unbelievable!

Legend has it that
they can't be seen
while they sleep...


Can you be trusted
with the truth?

I must ascertain
your worthiness.


...I will tell you
the truth...


In the past, there
were two nine-tier
towers here.

The BRASS TOWER,
which was said to

awaken POKéMON,
and the TIN TOWER,

where POKéMON were
said to rest.

The view from the
tops of the TOWERS

must have been
magnificent.

At the time, an
immense, silver-

colored POKéMON
was said to make

its roost atop the
BRASS TOWER.

However...

About 150 years
ago, a lightning

bolt struck one of
the TOWERS.

It was engulfed in
flames that raged
for three days.

A sudden downpour
finally put out
the blaze.

And that is how
the BURNED TOWER
came to be.


Let me see your
power!


Too strong!
Why?


You... Are you the
trainer who is

awaited by the
legendary POKéMON?


I see...

We, the WISE TRIO,
have been given 

the responsibility
of protecting the

legendary POKéMON.
We are to allow

passage only to
those people who

possess the power
and soul of truth.

Please, do go on
and enter the TIN
TOWER ahead.

SUICUNE will put
you to the test.


Please, do go on.

SUICUNE will put
you to the test.




Hi, I'm BILL. And
who are you?

Hmm, {A1}, huh?
You've come at the
right time.


I just finished
adjustments on my
TIME CAPSULE.

You know that
POKéMON can be
traded, right?

My TIME CAPSULE
was developed to

enable trades with
the past.

But you can't send
anything that

didn't exist in
the past.

If you did, the PC
in the past would
have a breakdown.

So you have to
remove anything

that wasn't around
in the past.

Put simply, no
sending new moves

or new POKéMON in
the TIME CAPSULE.

Don't you worry.
I'm done with the
adjustments.

Tomorrow, TIME
CAPSULES will be

running at all
POKéMON CENTERS.

I have to hurry on
back to GOLDENROD
and see my folks.

Buh-bye!


The way the KIMONO
GIRLS dance is

marvelous. Just
like the way they
use their POKéMON.


You must be hoping
to battle more

people, right?
There's apparently

some place where
trainers gather.

Where, you ask?

It's a little past
OLIVINE CITY.


MORTY, the GYM
LEADER, is soooo
cool.

His POKéMON are
really tough too.


LAKE OF RAGE...

The appearance of
a GYARADOS swarm...

I smell a conspir-
acy. I know it!




This happened when
I was young.

The sky suddenly
turned black. A

giant flying POKé-
MON was blocking
out the sun.

I wonder what that
POKéMON was? 

It was like a bird
and a dragon.


Is there really a
POKéMON that big?

If it exists, it
must be powerful.




You have lovely
POKéMON. May I see
them in battle?


Oh, you are very
strong.


I enjoyed that
bout. I would like
to see you again.


I always dance
with my POKéMON.

Of course, I also
train them.


Oh, so close!
I almost had you.


Rhythm is impor-
tant for both

dancing and POKé-
MON.


Isn't my barrette
pretty?

Oh. A POKéMON
battle?


I don't have any
POKéMON left...


I put a different
flower in my bar-
rette every month.


Oh, you're a cute
trainer. Would you
like to battle?


You're stronger
than you look.


I trained a lot,
so I thought I was

a capable trainer.
I guess I'm not.


Do you like my
dancing? I'm good
at POKéMON too.


Ooh, you're good
at POKéMON too.


I can keep dancing
because there are

people who enjoy
what I do.

My POKéMON keep my
spirits up too.


Not only are the
KIMONO GIRLS great

dancers, they're
also skilled at
POKéMON.

I always challenge
them, but I've

never even left a
scratch...


Lad! If you can
defeat all the

KIMONO GIRLS, I'll
give you a gift.


Lassie, if you can
defeat all the

KIMONO GIRLS, I'll
give you a gift.


The way you bat-
tled, it was like
watching a dance.

It was a rare
treat to see!

I want you to have
this. Don't worry
--take it!


That's SURF.

It's a move that
lets POKéMON swim
across water.


I wish my POKéMON
were as elegant as
the KIMONO GIRLS...


RHYDON: Gugooh
gugogooh!


That man's always
with his RHYDON.

Says he wants a
POKéMON that can
SURF and dance.

Is he trying to
make a synchro-
nized swimming
POKéMON?


The KIMONO GIRLS
are so beautiful...

But they have to
go through rigor-
ous training.

And they have to
learn to follow

customs before ap-
pearing in public.

But if you love
something, any-
thing is possible.


It's a fancy panel
that's decorated
with flowers.




My EEVEE evolved
into an ESPEON.

But my friend's
EEVEE turned into
an UMBREON.

I wonder why? We
both were raising

our EEVEE in the
same way...


If you use REVIVE,
a POKéMON that's

fainted will wake
right up.




Good of you to
have come.

Here in ECRUTEAK,
POKéMON have been
revered.

It's said that a
rainbow-colored

POKéMON will come
down to appear

before a truly
powerful trainer.

I believed that
tale, so I have

secretly trained
here all my life.

As a result, I can
now see what
others cannot.

Just a bit more...

With a little
more, I could see

a future in which
I meet the POKéMON
of rainbow colors.

You're going to
help me reach that
level!


I'm not good
enough yet...

All right. This
BADGE is yours.


{A1} received
FOGBADGE.


By having FOG-
BADGE, POKéMON up

to L50 will obey
you.

Also, POKéMON that
know SURF will be

able to use that
move anytime.

I want you to have
this too.


It's SHADOW BALL.
It causes damage

and may reduce
SPCL.DEF.

Use it if it
appeals to you.


I see...

Your journey has
taken you to far-
away places.

And you have wit-
nessed much more
than I.

I envy you for
that...


I spent the spring
with my POKéMON.

Then summer, fall
and winter...

Then spring came
again. We have

lived together
for a long time.


Wins and losses, I
experienced both.


Where did POKéMON
come from?


Can you inflict
any damage on our
POKéMON?


Ah! Well done!


We use only ghost-
type POKéMON.

No normal-type
attack can harm
them!


I shall win!


I, I, I lost!


The one who wants
to win most--will!


Stumped by our in-
visible floor?

Defeat me if you
want a hint!


Wha-what?


Fine. I shall tell
you the secret of

the invisible
floor.

The path is right
before our eyes!


The trainers here
have secret mo-
tives.

If you win, they
may tell you some

deep secrets about
ECRUTEAK.


Whew, {A1}.
You did great!

I was cowering in
the corner out of
pure terror!


MORTY, the GYM
LEADER, is absent.

Sorry, but you'll
have to leave.

Hohohoho.




Ah. You're on an
adventure with
your POKéMON?

Well, what's an
adventure without
treasure hunting?

Am I right, or am
I right?


Good! You under-
stand the true

spirit of adven-
ture.

I like that! Take
this with you.


There are many
items lying about

that aren't ob-
vious.

Use ITEMFINDER to
check if there is

an item on the
ground near you.

It doesn't show
the exact spot,

so you'll have to
look yourself.

Oh yeah--I heard
there are items

in ECRUTEAK's
BURNED TOWER.


Oh... To each his
own, I suppose...


HISTORY OF
ECRUTEAK

Want to read it?


In ECRUTEAK, there
were two towers.

Each tower was the
roost of powerful
flying POKéMON.

But one of the
towers burned to
the ground.

The two POKéMON
haven't been seen
since...

Keep reading?


ECRUTEAK was also
home to three

POKéMON that raced
around the town.

They were said to
have been born of

water, lightning
and fire.

But they could not
contain their
excessive power.

So they say the
three ran like the

wind off into the
grassland.




BLUE: Yo! Finally
got here, huh?

I wasn't in the
mood at CINNABAR,

but now I'm ready
to battle you.

...

You're telling me
you conquered all
the GYMS in JOHTO?

Heh! JOHTO's GYMS
must be pretty
pathetic then.

Hey, don't worry
about it.

I'll know if you
are good or not by

battling you right
now.

Ready, JOHTO
CHAMP?


BLUE: What?

How the heck did I
lose to you?

...

Tch, all right...
Here, take this--
it's EARTHBADGE.


{A1} received
EARTHBADGE.


BLUE: ...

All right, I was
wrong. You're the

real deal. You are
a good trainer.

But I'm going to
beat you someday.

Don't you forget
it!


BLUE: Listen, you.

You'd better not
lose until I beat
you. Got it?


Yo, CHAMP in
making!

How's it going?
Looks like you're
on a roll.

The GYM LEADER is
a guy who battled

the CHAMPION three
years ago.

He's no pushover.

Give it everything
you've got!


Man, you are truly
tough...

That was a heck of
an inspirational

battle. It brought
tears to my eyes.




Do you put a lot
of thought into

naming your
POKéMON?

Giving them good
nicknames adds to

the fun of trading
with others.


They're SPEARY--
a SPEAROW--and
RATTEY--a RATTATA.


SPEARY: Ch-chun!


RATTEY: Kikiii!




Welcome to TRAINER
HOUSE, the newest

and most happening
place in VIRIDIAN.

We're open to
trainers only.

You can battle
against the best

of the best right
downstairs.


VIRIDIAN is the
town closest to
INDIGO PLATEAU.

They built this
place because so

many trainers pass
through on their

way up to INDIGO
PLATEAU.


They hold practice
battles downstairs
here.

I would love to
see how well a

trainer from JOHTO
battles.


I guess you can't
become the CHAMP

unless you go all
over the place and

battle all kinds
of people.

The CHAMPION from
PALLET traveled to

all the cities and
towns in KANTO.


Whew... I'm taking a
rest from POKéMON
battles.


Practice battles
are held in the

TRAINING HALL
downstairs.

Skilled trainers
are invited to
participate.


There are no rules
or regulations for

practice matches.
Just like in field

battles, anything
goes!


...What's this?
A strategy memo?

This writing looks
like ONIX tracks...

It's completely
illegible...




Hi. Welcome to our
TRAINING HALL.

You may battle a
trainer once per
day.


 is your
opponent today.


Would you like to
battle?


Please go right
through.

You may begin
right away.


Sorry. Only those
trainers who will

be battling are
allowed to go in.


I'm sorry.
This would be your

second time today.
You're permitted

to enter just once
a day.


I lost...
Darn...


I traveled out
here just so I
could battle you.




The GYM LEADER
here is totally
cool.


Have you been to
CINNABAR?

It's an island way
south of here.




Where in the world
is VIRIDIAN's GYM

LEADER? I wanted
to challenge him.


There are no GYM
TRAINERS at the
VIRIDIAN GYM.

The LEADER claims
his policy is to

win without having
any underlings.


I heard that the
GYM in CINNABAR is
gone.

I wonder what be-
came of BLAINE,
the GYM LEADER.


My dream is to be-
come a GYM LEADER.




Hi! Wow, I'm glad
to see you.

You're the first
visitor I've had
in a long time.

I'm super-happy!
Let me give you a
little present.


That's a NUGGET.

I can't give you
any nuggets of

wisdom, so that'll
have to do!




Are you {14}?

I work as PROF.
OAK's AIDE.

I had no idea that
you were out here.

PROF.OAK's LAB is
nearby in PALLET
TOWN.




Only trainers who
have proven them-
selves may pass.


You don't have all
the GYM BADGES of
JOHTO.

I'm sorry, but I
can't let you go
through.


Oh! The eight
BADGES of JOHTO!

Please, go right
on through!


This way leads to
MT.SILVER.

You'll see scary-
strong POKéMON out
there.


Off to the POKéMON
LEAGUE, are you?

The ELITE FOUR are
so strong it's

scary, and they're
ready for you!




The SAILOR in the
OLIVINE CAFE next

door is really
generous.

He taught my
POKéMON STRENGTH.

Now it can move
big boulders.


There's a person
in CIANWOOD CITY
across the sea.

I heard him brag-
ging about his
rare POKéMON.




...Thank you for
your help at the
LIGHTHOUSE...

But this is dif-
ferent. Please

allow me to intro-
duce myself.

I am JASMINE, a
GYM LEADER. I use
the steel-type.

...Do you know about
the steel-type?

It's a type that
was only recently
discovered.

...Um... May I begin?


...You are a better
trainer than me,

in both skill and
kindness.

In accordance with
LEAGUE rules, I

confer upon you
this BADGE.


{A1} received
MINERALBADGE.


MINERALBADGE
raises POKéMON's
DEFENSE.

...Um... Please take
this too...


{A1} received
TM09.


...You could use
that TM to teach
IRON TAIL.


Um... I don't know
how to say this,
but good luck...


JASMINE uses the
newly discovered
steel-type.

I don't know very
much about it.


That was awesome.

The steel-type,
huh?

That was a close
encounter of an
unknown kind!


JASMINE, the GYM
LEADER, is at the
LIGHTHOUSE.

She's been tending
to a sick POKéMON.

A strong trainer
has to be compas-
sionate.




When my POKéMON
got sick, the

PHARMACIST in
ECRUTEAK made some
medicine for me.


RHYDON: Gugooh!




Along the way to
CIANWOOD, there

are four deserted
islands.

Bad kids are taken
to the islands as
punishment!


Whenever I get in
trouble, Daddy
always scares me.




OLIVINE is on the
sea!

And if it's on the
sea, there are
bound to be fish!

I've fished here
for 30 years.

Would you like to
face the sea and
fish?


Ah, hahah!
We have ourselves
a new angler!


Fish aren't found
in the sea alone.

They go wherever
there is water.


Whaaat? You don't
like to fish!?
Incomprehensible!


How are things?
Land the big one?




Hah! Your POKéMON
sure look like
lightweights!

They don't have
the power to move
boulders aside.

Here, use this
and teach them
STRENGTH!


On the sea, the
only thing you can

count on is your
own good self!

I'm so proud of my
buff bod!


OLIVINE CAFE's
menu is chock full

of hearty fare for
beefy SAILORS!


Whenever I roll
into this town, I

always visit the
OLIVINE CAFE.

Everything on the
menu makes me feel

stronger. I can't
stop eating!




Do your POKéMON
already know the

move for carrying
people on water?


My BUTTERFREE came
from my boyfriend
overseas.

It carried some
MAIL from him.

Want to know what
it says?

Let's see... Nope!
It's a secret!




Where did you say
you're from?

NEW BARK TOWN?

PROF.ELM lives
over there, right?

You've come a long
way to get here.




MOOMOO is sick...

She needs lots of
BERRIES.


We're feeding
MOOMOO!


MILTANK: ...Moo...


Its cry is weak...


MILTANK: Mooo!


Give a BERRY to
MILTANK?


{A1} gave a
BERRY to MILTANK.


MILTANK became a
little healthier!


MILTANK became
quite healthy!


MILTANK became
totally healthy!


{A1} has no
BERRIES...


{A1} wouldn't
give a BERRY.

MILTANK looks sad.




My MILTANK ain't
givin' me milk
n'more.

This here FARM's
got famous milk.

Most everyone
wants a drink.

It'll give me lots
o' milk if'n I

feed it lots o'
BERRIES, I reckon.


How'd you like my
MOOMOO MILK?

It's my pride and
joy, there.

Give it to POKéMON
to restore HP!

I'll give it to ya
fer just ¥500.


Here ya go!
Drink up'n enjoy!


Sorry, there.
No cash, no sale!


I reckon yer
PACK's full.


You don't want it?
Come again, hear?


I best go do my
milkin'.


Our milk even goes
out to KANTO.

So if our own
MILTANK won't give

us any milk, we're
in trouble.


You fixed our
MILTANK, hon. Now

it gives MOOMOO
MILK again.

Here's somethin'
fer your trouble.


{A1} received
TM13.


That there's
SNORE.

It's a rare move
that only works

while the POKéMON
is asleep.

You best think how
you ought to use
it, hon.




I, I'm in shock!

A guy about your
age with piercing

eyes and long hair
came in.

He scared me into
giving him my
prized POKéMON!

I still have one
left, but what if
he comes back?

You look strong.
Could you look

after my POKéMON
for a while?


Oh, thank you!

Take good care of
it, please!


{A1} received a
POKéMON.


Your POKéMON party
is full.


Oh, no... What'll
I do if he comes
back?


Hi! How's my POKé-
MON?

I think I'm safe
now, so may I have
it back?


Thank you!


Hey, you don't
have my POKéMON
with you.


My POKéMON has
come to like you.

All right, you
should keep it.

But promise to
be good to it!


Oh, no, no... That's
the same as being
robbed.


For POKéMON, hap-
piness is being

with a person who
treats them well.


If I take my POKé-
MON back, what are

you going to use
in battle?




WAHAHAH!

So you've come
this far!

Let me tell you,
I'm tough!

My POKéMON will
crush stones and
shatter bones!

Watch this!


CHUCK: Urggh!
...

Oooarrgh!


There! Scared now,
are you?

What?
It has nothing to

do with POKéMON?
That's true!

Come on. We shall
do battle!


Wha? Huh?
I lost?

How about that!
You're worthy of
STORMBADGE!


{A1} received
STORMBADGE.


STORMBADGE makes
all POKéMON up to

L70 obey, even
traded ones.

It also lets your
POKéMON use FLY

when you're not in
a battle.

Here, take this
too!


That is DYNAMIC-
PUNCH.

It doesn't always
hit, but when it

does, it causes
confusion!


WAHAHAH! I enjoyed
battling you!

But a loss is a
loss!

From now on, I'm
going to train 24
hours a day!


My POKéMON and I
are bound togeth-
er by friendship.

Our bond will
never be broken!


This isn't real!


You seem to have a
strong bond with
your POKéMON too!


We martial artists
fear nothing!


That's shocking!


Fighting POKéMON
are afraid of psy-
chics...


Words are useless.
Let your fists do
the talking!


...


I lost! 
I'm speechless!


My raging fists
will shatter your
POKéMON!


I got shattered!


My POKéMON lost...
My... my pride is
shattered...




Did you meet the
POKéMANIAC?

He's always brag-
ging about his
rare POKéMON.


The POKéMON GYM
trainers here are
macho bullies.

If I stick around,
they might come
after me.

Here's some ad-
vice: the GYM

LEADER uses the
fighting-type.

So you should
confound him with
psychic POKéMON.

Wipe out his POKé-
MON before they

can use their
physical strength.

And those boulders
in the middle of
the GYM?

If you don't move
them correctly,

you won't reach
the GYM LEADER.

If you get stuck,
go outside.


{A1}! You won!
I could tell by
looking at you!


Don't you get the
urge to show off

your POKéMON to
friends?

I wish I could
show the POKéMON I

raised to my pal
in VIOLET.


I've been battling
my pal in VIOLET

using a MOBILE
ADAPTER link.

I'm down 5-7
against him. I've
gotta crank it up!


I love showing off
the POKéMON that

I've raised.
Don't you?

I'm going to get
into a bunch of

battles, and show
off my POKéMON!




Your POKéMON ap-
pear to be fine.

Is something wor- 
rying you?

...

The LIGHTHOUSE
POKéMON is in
trouble?

I got it!

This ought to do
the trick.


{A1} received
SECRETPOTION.


My SECRETPOTION is
a tad too strong.

I only offer it in
an emergency.




You have magnifi-
cent POKéMON with
you.

How about a photo
for a souvenir?


OK! Big smile now!


Oh, that's too
bad. I thought it

would be a great
memento...




You came from
OLIVINE?

Do you remember
the four islands
along the way?

I heard that a 
mythical sea crea-
ture is hiding in
them.


I heard that you
can only see it if

you have a SILVER
WING.

It must have the
same scent as the
creature.


I've heard that
the whirlpools

around the islands
are caused by the
sea creature.

You might need a
special move to
get past them.




BATTLE TOWER
welcomes you!

I could show you
to a BATTLE ROOM.


Want to go into a
BATTLE ROOM?


Right this way to
your BATTLE ROOM.


BATTLE TOWER is a
facility made for
POKéMON battles.

Countless POKéMON
trainers gather

from all over to
hold battles in

specially designed
BATTLE ROOMS.

There are many
BATTLE ROOMS in
the BATTLE TOWER.

Each ROOM holds
seven trainers.

If you defeat the
seven in a ROOM,

and you have a
good record, you

could become the
ROOM's LEADER.

All LEADERS will
be recorded in the

HONOR ROLL for
posterity.

You may challenge
in up to five

BATTLE ROOMS each
day.

However, you may
battle only once a

day in any given
ROOM.

To interrupt a
session, you must

SAVE. If not, you
won't be able to

resume your ROOM
challenge.

BATTLE TOWER rules
are written here.

Read the rules?


Three POKéMON may
enter battles.

All three must be
different.

The items they
hold must also be
different.

Certain POKéMON
may also have

level restrictions
placed on them.


Excuse me!
You didn't SAVE

before exiting
the BATTLE ROOM.

I'm awfully sorry,
but your challenge

will be declared
invalid.


Your POKéMON will
be healed to full
health.


Next up, opponent

Your session will
be SAVED before

We've been waiting

to a BATTLE ROOM,
please.


You may enter only
five BATTLE ROOMS
each day.

Please come back
tomorrow.


Sorry, but it's
not possible to

Sorry, but it's

One or more of
your POKéMON's
levels exceeds

enter a BATTLE
ROOM under L70.

This BATTLE ROOM
is for L.


Destroyed by the
first opponent in

no time at all...
I'm no good...


There are lots of
BATTLE ROOMS, but

I'm going to win
them all!


It's a grueling
task, not being

able to use items
in battle.

Making your
POKéMON hold items

is the key to
winning battles.


I'm trying to see
how far I can go

using just bug
POKéMON.

Don't let there be
any fire POKéMON...




You'll be returned
after you SAVE.




Did you come to
see the BATTLE
TOWER too?

But I guess you
can't go in yet.


BATTLE TOWER has
opened.

I want to go, but
I haven't thought

up a cool line for
when I win.


Are you going to
the BATTLE TOWER?

This is a secret,
but if you win a

whole lot, you can
win special gifts.


I'm going to train
my POKéMON so I'll

be all ready for
the BATTLE TOWER.


The levels of the
POKéMON I want to

use are all
different.

I have to go train
them now!




Wow, the BATTLE
TOWER is huge! My

neck is tired from
looking up at it.


Wow, the BATTLE
TOWER is huge!

Since there are a
whole bunch of

trainers inside,
there must also be

a wide variety of
POKéMON.


Wow, the BATTLE
TOWER is huge!

There must be many
kinds of POKéMON
in there!


What on earth do
they do here?

If the name says
anything, I guess

it must be for
POKéMON battles.


You can use only
three POKéMON.

It's so hard to
decide which three

should go into
battle...


Ehehehe...
I sneaked out of
work to come here.

I'm never giving
up until I become
a LEADER!


Hehehe, I snuck
out from work.

I can't bail out
until I've won!

I have to win it
all. That I must!


BATTLE TOWER


BATTLE TOWER

Take the Ultimate
Trainer Challenge!


The BATTLE TOWER's
doors are closed...


It's open!




Hi, this is BUENA...

Oh! Good morning,
{14}!

I'm kind of foggy
in the morning...


Hi, this is BUENA...
Oh! Hi, {14}!

Do you tune into
BUENA's show?


This is BUENA.
I can't come to

the phone right
now.

If you want to
chat, tune into

BUENA's PASSWORD
on the radio and

give me a call
after midnight!


Hi, this is BUENA...
Oh! Hi, {14}!

I just got off
work. 

Let me tell you,
I'm exhausted!


{14}!
Hi, it's BUENA!

I got up early, so
I decided to call!


{14}!
Hi, it's BUENA!

I needed someone
to chat with!


{14}!
Hi, it's BUENA!

I'm just on my
break.


{14}!
Hi, it's BUENA!

I couldn't sleep,
so I called you.


Oh. Hi, {14}!

You are how?

Aiyee! This isn't
the time for me to

be cracking silly
gag greetings!

The RADIO TOWER is
in deep trouble!

{14}, you'd
better be careful!


The other day, I
went out to eat

with DJ BEN!
Isn't it great?

Not only that, he
said the music on

my program is
cool!

Oh, wow! Like,
what should I do?

...Oops, I have to
get ready for my

show! I'll catch
you later!


You know the
receptionist at
the RADIO TOWER?

'Welcome,' is all
she ever says.

But she's really
the chattiest

person at the
RADIO TOWER.

So she must be
holding back.

Isn't that fun to
know?

Catch you later!


Tell me, {14}.
Have you ever won

a prize on the
LUCKY NUMBER SHOW?

REED moans that
he's never won, so

he vows to keep
the show on the
air till he does.

Let's chat again!


You know, last
night...

I was so stressed
out from work, I

ate a ton of junk
food!

MARY and I have
this deal about
losing weight...

This won't do...

Huh? What's the
weight?

This has to be a
total secret!

MARY weighs...

Aiyee! M-MARY!

Uh... Um... I... Sorry,
wrong number!


Yesterday, PROF.
OAK was in the

studio to tape his
show.

So I went over and
introduced myself.

Get this--he tunes
in to my program!

Oh! Here comes
PROF.OAK again!

I'm going to chat
him up again!

Catch you later!


...Cough, cough!

Uhm sorry uh got
uh code dite now.

Buh uma pro so uh
hav to cover id ub

so no un notice
while uhm on air.

Uh fidz muh voice
now.

I'll catch you on
the fly. This has
been BUENA!


Hey, {14}.
You won that RADIO

CARD by beating
the quiz at the

reception desk,
didn't you?

Guess what? I made
up the questions!

...Were they too
easy for you?

Well, let's chat
again!


I'm elated that
more people are

taking part in my
PASSWORD show.

But when PIKACHU
was the password,

it was uh... whew...
overwhelming.

FAN CLUB people
came in out in

droves, shouting
'PIKACHU!' over

and over. I mean,
they were loud.

Anyone tuning in
around then must

have been shocked
by the racket!

Anyway, back to
work for me!

Let's chat again!


Guess what?
The RADIO TOWER's

DIRECTOR is a big
fan of TV!

A while ago, a
fashion show on TV

said that black
suits were in.

Now all he wears
are black suits.

But it's a secret
that our DIRECTOR

is a TV fan, so if
you see him, don't

you dare mention
it!

Oh! The DIRECTOR
will be here soon!

Later! Tune into
my show!


{14}, tell me.

When do you relax
the most?

For me, it has to
be in the studio

right after my
show, enjoying a

nice cup of tea.
It's so pleasant

that it gradually
makes me drowsy...

...... ...... ......

...... ...... ......Zzz

Oops, I drifted
off just thinking

about it! How, uh...
embarrassing!

Please forget this
happened! Later!


{14}, what was
the first POKéMON
you ever caught?

...Oh, really?

I've seen lots of
POKéMON around,

but I've never
caught one.

I should give it a
try sometime.

Did you know that
the first POKéMON

MARY caught was a
DROWZEE?

Isn't that so out
of character?

But MARY's DROWZEE
kept making her

fall asleep on the
job, so she traded

with a fan for a
MEOWTH.

Let's chat about
POKéMON again!

Bye-bye!


Guess what? All of
us from the RADIO

TOWER are going on
a company vacation

to the RADIO TOWER
in LAVENDER.

We're wasting our
vacation on a trip

to another RADIO
TOWER?

I'd much rather go
to the beach!

{14}, I hope
you have enough

fun for both of us
on your journey!

Bye-bye!


Did you know...?

BEN and FERN talk
on the phone for

hours about what
POKéMON music they

should play on
different days of
the week.

One time, FERN's
rapping style kind

of rubbed off on
BEN weirdly.

So we ended up
enduring BEN's

silly, chilly, a
willy-nilly jive-
talking shtick for
a while.

Let's chat again!


I'm going shopping
with MARY and LILY
soon.

It'll be great if
GOLDENROD DEPT.

STORE has a sale
on when we go...

{14}, maybe we
can hook up too!

Catch you later!


I'm thinking of
going to the GAME

CORNER tomorrow.
It's been a while.

You see, I have my
favorite machine...

It pays out a lot,
I kid you not!

Huh? Nuh-uh, it's
my secret!

You have to find
it yourself!

Catch you later!


Hey, {14}. You
use your POKéGEAR

to listen to the
radio, right?

I heard that you
can even display

town maps with
POKéGEAR.

I have a bad sense
of direction, so

POKéGEAR would be
handy...

Anyway, thanks for
calling! Later!


Is it sunny
outside today?

When you're cooped
up in the RADIO

TOWER as much as I
am, you lose touch

with the outside.
It can be boring.

Please call again!




By the way, I'm a
HIKER, so I often

go to mountains
and caves.

I occasionally see
rare POKéMON.

I could call you
the next time I
see one.

Feel like swapping
phone numbers?


I could call you
when I see some
rare POKéMON.

Feel like swapping
phone numbers?


Be patient. I'll
find some rare
POKéMON for you!


You're cold. I may
as well head to
the mountains...


Your phone's full.

It can't register
my phone number.


All righty, then!

My POKéMON and I
are raring to go!


From here, I can
see GOLDENROD's

DEPT.STORE. They
have bargain sales

up on the rooftop
every so often.

Could I get your
phone number?

I'll call you when
they have a sale.


If you give me
your number, I'll

call you when they
have a sale.


I check GOLDENROD
DEPT.STORE every

day, so I know
when there's a
sale.


Anyway...

If you're short on
money, take down
my number.

I'll call you when
there's a sale.


Your phone doesn't
have enough memory
for more numbers.


I waited for you!
I even cut back my

shopping to raise
my POKéMON better!


Shopping under the
sky!

It feels so nice
up on a rooftop.


Whenever I see a
strong trainer, I

want to be their
cheerleader.

When I'm on my
walk, I sometimes
pick up items.

If I get anything,
you can have it!

Want to give me
your number?

I'll call as soon
as I get anything.


If I find an item,
you can have it!

Want to give me
your number?


I'll call as soon
as I get anything!


Is that so? Well,
I'll still be
rooting for you!


But your phone is
all filled up!


I've been waiting!

I've gotten a bit
better at this!


So you're finally
here!

I think this will
make you happy.


Your PACK looks
completely full.

I'll have to hold
on to this.


You're the best
I've ever battled!

Huh? You're the
one who saved all
the SLOWPOKE?

Well, no wonder I
couldn't beat you!

Would it be OK to
get your number?

I don't want to
miss anything you
do from now on!


You will tell me
your phone number?


Wow! Gee, thanks!
Now I can call you

anytime, whether
anything's up or

not. You know,
just to chat!


Oh, but...
I'm not dangerous!

I just want to
call and chat

about everything
and nothing!


Your phone list is
already full...

You must be really
popular...


Do you get the
feeling that there

are more rare
POKéMON around?

I'm positive there
are, so I look all
the time.

If I find one, I
want to share the

good news with
everyone I know.

I know! Give me
your phone number.


I want to let
people know if I
see rare POKéMON.

Please give me
your phone number!


If I spot any
awesome POKéMON,

I'll be sure to
give you a call!


Aww! I want to
tell someone about
my discoveries!


There's no space
for my number.

If you make room,
register me!


It's my turn to
win now!

I've turned over a
new leaf!


Reading textbooks
is worthwhile
every so often.

When I'm reading
and walking, I
have to look down.

So I notice items
on the ground.

Next time I find
something, I'll
give it to you.

May I have your
phone number?


If I find some-
thing, it's yours.

So may I have your
phone number?


I'll call you as
soon as I find

something. You can
count on it!


Oh... I thought it
would be a good

break to call you
when I'm studying...


There's no room
for my number.


I waited around
for you!

I'm thoroughly
prepared today!


This, this! This
is yours! Ta-da!


Whoops!

You can't carry
any more items!

I'll hold it until
next time.


You're really good
at POKéMON!

Boys give me items
after battles, but

sometimes they
give me too much.

Next time, I can
share some if you

want. Let me get
your phone number.


I'll share my
gifts with you.

Let me get your
phone number.


Next time a boy
gives me something

after a battle,
I'll share some!

Does that make me
bad?


Aww, you don't
want anything?

But it's all for
free...


But your phone's
out of memory!


You're really
late!

I'm eager to get
going!


Hi! Are you here
for your gift?

This should really
make your day!


Where are you
going to put this?

I'll keep it, so
come get it later!


Huh? Is that thing
a POKéDEX? Have
you met PROF.OAK?

Huh? You have? 
That's way cool!

I have a dream of
becoming a POKéMON

researcher like
PROF.OAK.

May I please have
your phone number?

We should chat
about PROF.OAK.

I'm sure it will
be loads of fun!


May I please have
your phone number?

We should chat
about PROF.OAK.

I'm sure it will
be loads of fun!


You must listen to
PROF.OAK'S POKéMON
TALK, right?


Oh... I wish I had a
chance to meet
PROF.OAK...


Your phone list is
completely full!


I've been waiting!
Let's battle now!


Oh, wow! PIKACHU!
It's so soft and
furry! How cute!

Let's be friends!
PIKACHU-lovers are
never bad people!

Let's chat about
PIKACHU!

Can I get your
phone number?


Let's chat about
PIKACHU!

Can I get your
phone number?


PIKACHU is the
one! If anything

comes up, I'll
give you a jingle.


You...

I bet you don't
even like PIKACHU...


Wait a sec! Your
phone list's full!


I've been looking
for you! Here, see
this? This is it!

I'm certain your
PIKACHU will love
my gift too!


Uh-oh, too bad.
You don't have any

room. Be sure to
get it later.


Hey, you're trying
to be the ultimate

trainer too? Then
we're comrades!

If I find any more
items by the

water, I'll give
you some.

Just give me your
phone number.


If I find any more
items by the

water, I'll give
you some.

Just give me your
phone number.


You'll be hearing
from me if I find
something good.


Is that so? Then
I'll just have to
use them myself.


Your phone list is
all filled up.

Come back if you
make room for me.


I've been doing
more than just

fishing since we
last met.

You're in for a
big surprise!


Hey, there you
are!

Here's a gift, as
promised!


Your PACK's full?

Come back later--
that'll do it.


By the way, you're
a POKéMANIAC...

I can tell.
Yes, you are.

But your knowledge
is shallow still!

Do you know BILL?
He's an incredible

POKéMANIAC.
I revere him.

I'll teach you all
I know about BILL,

so leave me your
phone number.


I'll teach you all
I know about BILL,

so leave me your
phone number.


BILL--he's more
than amazing!

To be a POKéMANIAC
like him someday...

That's my dream.


You're going to
regret it...

And I won't care...


Huh? Your phone
list's full.

A POKéMANIAC has
to be more tidy!


I've been waiting.

Look, check out my
POKéMON!


Hi! You like
CLEFAIRY too?

They're so very
cute, aren't they?

I think we can be
good friends!

I want to know
your phone number!

Let's talk about
CLEFAIRY!


I want to know
your phone number!

Let's talk about
CLEFAIRY!


Isn't my CLEFAIRY
super-adorable?


Aww... Oh well.
Look for me if you

want to talk about
CLEFAIRY.


Oh? Your phone
registry is full.


There you are!

CLEFAIRY, I want
you to try hard!


You took a long
time. See this?

Isn't it cute?
It's a PINK BOW.


Uh-oh. Your PACK
is crammed full.


You know, you are
really strong.

But I don't want
to just slink off...

I know! Could I
get your number?

Let's meet up for
more battles!


I want to battle
tough trainers as
often as I can!

Could I get your
number?

Let's meet up for
more battles!


Don't forget to
come see me when I
challenge you!


A bird-user friend
isn't a bad thing
to have, I think...

Won't you
reconsider?


Your phone's out
of memory. Delete
a number for me!


Am I happy to see
you! I won't lose!


Oh, too bad. You
don't have room.

I'll give it to
you next time!


You are really,
really strong!

Thanks for taking
me on so often--I

learned a whole
lot from you.

I know! This will
do as my thanks!


Eh, our battle was
fun, I'd say...

When I'm fishing,
I sometimes snag

items that people
have dropped.

Do you want them?
What's the number?


If I snag an item
while I'm fishing,

it's yours. What's
your number?


If I snag anything
good, I'll be sure
to let you know.


All right... Come
back if you have a
change of heart.


You can't register
another number.


Argh! You startled
POLIWAG into
fleeing again!


So here you are.

See this?
I snagged it just

a little while
ago. It's yours.


Your PACK's full?

I'll give it to
you later.


Our battle was
remarkable!

I wish for some-
thing to remember
you by!

Perhaps your phone
number will do?

My training makes
it impossible to
chat much, but...


My training makes
chatting tough,

but will you take
down my number?


I must train
harder to become
the mightiest!


If you decide you
want my number,
come see me.


Your phone appears
to be full.

Come back later!


I wish to thank
you, {A1}!

I've been training
all alone...

I was happy that
you cared to call...

I want you to have
this!


Your strength will
not let you carry

another thing!
I will hold this

till you lighten
your PACK!


Sheesh, the way
you attacked! That

was something! We
should meet again!

How about giving
me your number?


So you want to
register my phone

number for a re-
match, huh?


I'll call you
whenever I feel
like battling!


No? That's fine.

A definite no is
easy to take!

I'll be right here
when you're ready
for a rematch.


Oh? There's no
room to register
my phone number.


Hey, here comes
the kid! Let's go!

Ready for my usual
no-brainer, all-
out offense?


Your PACK looks
stuffed full!

You can't have
this now.


Well, you're
special all right.

If only I'd begun
POKéMON when I was
a tad younger...

I want you to work
and succeed for

the both of us.
So take this, OK?


It really made me
angry to lose.

I'll have to train
much harder...

Here's my number.
I'm ERIN--don't

forget! Want to
battle me again?


I want to battle
with you again.

Do you want to
exchange numbers?


I'll remember to
call when I want
to battle again!


Oh... I'm sad...
If you do want to

battle, come see
ERIN--that's me!


Oh no. Your phone
is all filled up.


Yay! I waited!
Let's start now!


That's too bad!
You have no room...

I'll give it to
you another time.


Aww... I lost again!

I wonder how many
times that is...

Thanks for coming!
Here's a present!

Hi, {14}!
Our BICYCLE sales

have gone through
the roof!

We owe it all to
your advertising

by riding around
on our BICYCLE.

As our way of say-
ing thanks, please

keep that BICYCLE.
Thanks again!


My 's
intelligence keeps

rising. It might
be smarter than
yours!


The other day, I
easily defeated a
.

I think swapping
tips with you is
starting to help.


Oh, and listen.
I missed catching

a  by
just a tiny bit.

If I'd been a bit
more informed, I'm

sure I would've
caught it...


Do you want to
battle? I'll show

you how to battle
logically.

I'll be in
.

Give me a shout if
you're nearby.


See you later!


Did you know?

When it's raining,
THUNDER is sure to
strike.


Did you know...?

If you use DEFENSE
CURL, ROLLOUT's

power goes way up
past normal.


Did you know...?

If the sunlight is
harsh, SOLARBEAM

doesn't need to be
charged up.


Did you know...?

If the opponent
uses MINIMIZE,

your STOMP becomes
more powerful.


Did you know...?

If your opponent
is FLYing, your

GUST becomes much
more powerful.


Did you know...?

If your opponent
is FLYing, your

TWISTER becomes
more powerful.


Did you know...?

If your opponent
uses DIG, your

EARTHQUAKE becomes
more powerful.


Did you know...?

If your opponent
uses DIG, your

MAGNITUDE becomes
more powerful.


Did you know...?

The rock, ground
and steel types

can't be hurt by
SANDSTORM.


Did you know...?

If the sunlight is
harsh, water-type

moves become much
weaker.


Did you know...?

When it's raining,
fire-type moves

become much weaker
than usual.


My friend heard
some great tips.

He's going to let
me in on some.

When he tells me,
I'll call right
away and tell you.


Hey, {14}!

Do you remember
your promise?

We have to battle
soon!

I'll be at
.


I fancied up my
 and

made it even cuter
than before!


I happened to come
across a wild
SNUBBULL recently.

My SNUBBULL, I
assure you, was

far cuter than the
wild one.


I happened to see
a wild MARILL the

other day.
Or so I thought.

A closer look
showed it was

. I was
quite miffed.


You can expect a
call from me.


My husband got
some NUGGETS.

If you'd like, you
could have one as

thanks for helping
me out.

I'll be at
.

Please come see me
when you can.


Are your POKéMON
in prime form?

Let's chat about
POKéMON again.


Pardon?
Oh, the NUGGET?

There's no need to
hurry. Come see me

in 
when you can.


Hey, I challenge
you to a battle!

It won't be like
last time!

's
where I'm waiting

for you. Hustle
over here pronto!


See ya!


We have to battle
again sometime.

You can bet I'm
going to keep

challenging you
till I win.


Hey, you'd better
not have forgotten
about our battle!

!

Hustle over quick!
I'm waiting!


My 
might be greater
than I imagined.

I doubt I'll see a
 that's
better than mine.


Oh, and I managed
to barely defeat

 the
other day.

I've never seen a
 get
that strong...

You shouldn't let
your guard down,

even against a
POKéMON you're
used to seeing.


And a while back,
I tried to catch a
wild .

But it managed to
elude me.

One wrong decision
could mean total

failure... You ought
to be careful too.


Let's battle!

I'll be waiting on
.

Give me a shout
when you're close.


OK, I'll talk to
you soon!


I obsess over how
to beat you.


{14}, why
aren't you here?

I'll take you down
with !


Do you remember my
sweet ?

 runs
very fast.

It's exhilarating
to ride on its

back when it
really gets going.


Oh, have you ever
seen a 
before?

I just battled
one...

It was much faster
than I expected.

I was a little
shocked.

I still won, of
course.


Oh, I just saw a
wild .

I was trying to
catch it when I

noticed that I was
all out of POKé
BALLS.

If you don't check
your items, you

may run out at the
worst time.

I hope you learn
from my mistake.


Do you want to
battle? I'm going
to win this time!

I'll be waiting
for you around

.
Look for me, OK?


OK, bye-bye!


Let's battle again
sometime!


Um... {14}?
What's wrong?

Did you forget our
deal?

.

That's where I'm
waiting.


Hey listen, my
's stick

has this really
delicious aroma.

That aroma gets my
appetite going!


A while ago, my
FARFETCH'D KO'd
this .

You should have
seen FARFETCH'D

wield that stick.
Amazing stuff!


I ran into a wild
...

I was trying to
catch it, but it

took off faster
than I thought it

would. It was a
bit disappointing.


Want to battle
again?

For some reason,
my FARFETCH'D is

all worked up and
raring to go.

's
where I'm at.

Keep an eye out
for me, OK?


Be seeing you!


My FARFETCH'D had
something pretty
in its beak.

Like I promised,
you can have it.

Catch up to me on
,

and I'll let you
have it.


I haven't gotten
what I promised
you yet.

I'll call you as
soon as I get it,

so could you wait
a little longer?


{14}, could you
hurry over?

FARFETCH'D is
agitated.

If you don't come
soon, it might

smack me with its
stick!

!

Please come as
soon as you can!


What's wrong?

Don't you want
this gift?

Catch up to me on
,

and I'll let you
have it.


Listen, dear...

Do you recall my
?

Yes, exactly. That
lovely .

Wouldn't you agree
it's a perfect
match for me?


Have I ever faced
a wild ?

You need to ask?

 I've
beaten on numerous
occasions!


Have I ever failed
to catch a wild
POKéMON?

You need to ask?

I would never fail
to catch a wild

...
Oh! Never mind!


We are going to
battle!

The place shall be
!

Don't make me
wait! Got it?


Fine, you may go.


Don't be too proud
just because you

happened to beat
me... 

It was a fluke!


What are you
doing?

I told you that
the place was

!
Don't try to run!


My 's
looking sharper
than before!

I doubt there's a
POKéMON as cool as

this guy in your
party!


Oh yeah, I took
down a 

in the wild the
other day.

It was a cakewalk.
Well, I guess it

can't be helped,
us being so tough.


Oh yeah, I saw a
wild !

I thought about
going for it, but

I decided to work
with my one-and-

only right to the
extreme end.


Let's get together
and battle!

I promise things
will be different!

's
where I'll be.

Give me a shout
when you come.


All right. Later!


I'm checking out
's moves

and devising some
strategies.

When I come up
with a good one,
let's battle!


What's keeping
you, {A1}!

Let's get down and
battle already!

I'm waiting on
!


Are your POKéMON
growing?

My POKéMON are
growing a bit too

quickly for me.
It's overwhelming!

's grow-
ing especially

quickly. I think
it'll get tough.


Oh yeah, we KO'd a
wild 

with one hit a
while back.

It went down so
easily, I felt a

little sorry for
the poor thing.


Oh yeah, a wild
 got

away from me at
the last second.

I know it's a
common POKéMON...

But it does annoy
me that it got

away when I almost
had it.


Do you feel like a
POKéMON battle?

It won't be like
last time!

's
where I'll be.

Let me know when
you get there.


See you later!


The Bug-Catching
Contest is at the

NATIONAL PARK
today.

Are you going,
{14}?

I'm trying to make
up my mind.


I found all kinds
of BERRIES. If you

want, I'll share
some with you.

I'll be waiting on
.


Huh? BERRIES?

Sorry, I haven't
found any yet.

I'll call you if I
find any. Will you
please wait?


Let's battle
already!

 is
where I am.

Please get here as
soon as you can!


How come you're
not here yet?

 is
where I am.

Please get here as
soon as you can!


I've been spending
more time with my

 than I
have with my kids.

That's a bit sad,
actually.


I just beat a wild
.

I told my kid, but
he scoffed that he

could do the same
thing easily.

Boy, has he gotten
cocky...


Yesterday a wild
 slipped

away from me, in
front of my kid.

I was feeling down
about it until he

shared his POKé
BALLS with me.

Hahah, that sure
made my day!


What do you say to
a battle with me?

Good, you're going
to do it!

For a kid, you're
quite agreeable.

 is
the spot!


You call your mom
sometimes too!


Listen, I... Yowch!

Uh, sorry! See,
 are

biting like there
is no tomorrow

over here on
!

Aiyee! Ouch!
One jabbed me!

Heh, they're some
kind of feisty!

{14}, you have
to see this rare

sight! Get ready
to fish!


Yeah, I know.

You're looking for
rare POKéMON.

Recently, all I've
been catching are
MAGIKARP, though...


So where are you?
I'm waiting for

you to show up on
.

You shouldn't make
your elders wait!


Hey, what's the
matter with you?

Aren't you coming
over to fish for
QWILFISH?

I'm on ROUTE 32,
so hurry up!


Oh, you have to
hear this.

My  is
so adorable!

It always wants to
nuzzle me!


And, and! Um...

We beat a wild
 with

just one hit a
little while ago.

We felt sorry for
it, though.


And, and! Uh...

We just saw a
really gorgeous
.

But I was on the
phone, so it got

away. It made us
really angry!


Hi! Do you have
some free time?

I've got all sorts
of time. If you're

free, would you
like to battle?

I'll be waiting on
.

Let me know when
you get here!


Hi, TANIA. How are
you? This is LIZ.

I'm fine, but I'm
bored silly!

Huh... Wrong number?
Oops! Sorry!


OK, I'll call you
later!


Listen, listen!

I was listening to
the radio in the

RUINS OF ALPH when
an odd broadcast

suddenly cut it on
the regular show.

I wonder what it
was. So strange!


Listen, listen!

Don't you think
FALKNER of VIOLET

GYM is cool and
handsome?

But they say his
dad, who's out

training on the
road, is even more

cool and handsome
than FALKNER.

I wish I could
meet him!


Listen, listen!

Do you know EARL,
the teacher who

runs the POKéMON
ACADEMY in VIOLET?

I saw him doing
pirouettes while

he was running. It
was wildly funny!


Listen, listen!

I collect POKéMON
plush dolls.

But I can't seem
to get a hold of a

SURF PIKACHU DOLL.
None of my friends

have it. It must
be totally rare!

You could really
brag about it if
you had one.


Listen, listen!

Do you know about
MOOMOO MILK?

You can buy it at
MOOMOO FARM.

It's supposed to
be good for health

and beauty.
I really want to

try some. I bet
it's delicious!


Listen, listen!

There's a POKéMON
SALON in GOLDENROD

that's run by two
brothers.

The older brother
is good, but the

younger one really
isn't.

But sometimes the
younger one does a

better job than
his brother.

Every time I go, I
have a hard time

trying to decide
whom I should use...


Listen, listen!

GOLDENROD GYM's
WHITNEY began

battling only a
little while ago!

But the POKéMON
LEAGUE chose her
as a GYM LEADER!

I bet she must be
totally talented.


Listen, listen!

Have you ever
taken part in a

Bug-Catching
Contest at the
NATIONAL PARK?

I did once, but
all I could catch
was a CATERPIE.

But guess what!

I won with that
CATERPIE. Isn't
that great?


Listen, listen!

I saw a beautiful
!

I wish I could
become a beautiful
 too.


Listen, listen!

Uh... Um... Whoops!

I forgot what I
was going to say!


Listen, listen!

My ...
it... so pretty...

and... giggle... so
awesome... yes... but...

very much... eeek!
And... lovely...

Just ravishing...
Oh, too much!

...Hug it... sleeping...
That's right...

pretty... sigh... So
nice... Cute...

...Oops! Look at the
time! I chatted
too long!

I'm sorry I took
so much of your

time!
I love chatting!


I've got too much
time on my hands!

Let's battle right
away!

I'll be waiting on
!


The other day, I
was watching my

 eat
some BERRIES.

It looked like it
was enjoying its

meal, so I decided
to try some.

I'm not sure if
people should eat

that stuff, but it
was delicious!


Lately, I've been
running across

wild 
quite often.

They're easily
taken care of.


Oh yeah, I was
battling this

 the
other day...

It took off when I
got distracted by
a passing BEAUTY.

Learn from my
mistake--always

stay focused on
the job at hand!


Come on--let's
battle right now!

 is
where I am.

Come on down if
you feel up to it!


All right then!
Be good!


{A1}! It's
mind-blowing!

I took a hike in

yesterday, see?

Well, there were
tons of 

around! You have
to see it!

I get this feeling
that 

may be timid.
I didn't see any

where there are
strong POKéMON.


Rare POKéMON?

Hey, sorry! I was
too focused on my

hike, so I wasn't
paying attention.


Hello! You haven't
forgotten about

our battle, have
you?

!
I'm waiting!


Hello? What? Where
is DUNSPARCE?

DARK CAVE! Hurry!

I know I've said
it before, but

DUNSPARCE don't
appear when there

are strong POKéMON
around.


My  is
looking more and

more like me. It's
getting cuter!


And, you know?

Now we can KO
 easily.

I should challenge
the GOLDENROD GYM.


And, you know?
We just failed to

beat  by
a tiny margin.

I'm guessing my
POKéMON's levels

aren't high enough
yet...


You must be a lot
better now, huh?

How about showing
me your technique

in a real battle
with me?

I'll be waiting on
.


See you later!


This is it--the
one we've all been
waiting for!

GOLDENROD DEPT.
STORE's bargain
sale is on now!

Want it cheap?
Want it lots?

Don't miss this
GOLDENROD chance!

Huh? I sound like
a huckster?

Well, yeah. I was
mimicking them...

Anyway, you've got
to get there as
soon as you can!


I'm saving up for
the next bargain

sale. When's the
next one?


Where are you?

Let's have our
battle soon!

I'll be waiting on
.


Haven't you gone
to GOLDENROD DEPT.

STORE? I've scoped
it out already!

They had some real
bargains.

You should get
there quickly.


My  and
I are getting more

in sync with each
other.


We battled a wild
 and

managed to drop it
in a close match.

We're getting into
the groove!


But, you know?

I still haven't
caught .

It's getting past
frustrating...


Would you be my
practice partner
again sometime?

I'll be waiting on
.

...Could you take it
a little easier on
me next time?


Bye! Let's chat
again!


Have you heard
about TEAM ROCKET?

They've taken over
the RADIO TOWER in
GOLDENROD.

Are the people
inside safe?


I picked up some-
thing nice today.

I want you to have
it, so I called!

You will come for
it, won't you?

 is
where I am.


Sorry, I haven't
found anything

useful yet...
I promise, if I

find anything, you
can have it!


Oh, {14}!
How soon can I

expect to see you
for our battle?

Don't forget,
!


I'm getting really
impatient, waiting

to give you my
present!

Hurry over to
!

Challenge
Explanation
Cancel


At the POKéMON
LEAGUE, you'll get

tested by the
ELITE FOUR.

You have to beat
them all. If you

lose, you have to
start all over!


Hold it.

You're going to
take the POKéMON

LEAGUE challenge
now?

That's not going
to happen.

My super-well-
trained POKéMON

are going to pound
you.

{A1}!
I challenge you!


...

OK--I lost...


...Darn... I still
can't win...

I... I have to think
more about my
POKéMON...

Humph! Try not to
lose!


...

Whew...
With my partners,

I'm going to be
the CHAMPION!


Ah! You're chal-
lenging the ELITE

FOUR? Are you sure
you're ready?

If you need to
train some more,

my ABRA can help
you.

It can TELEPORT
you home.

Would you like to
go home now?


OK, OK. Picture
your house in your
mind...


OK, OK. The best
of luck to you!


ABRA: Aabra...






Welcome to POKéMON
LEAGUE, {A1}.

Allow me to intro-
duce myself. I am
WILL.

I have trained all
around the world,

making my psychic
POKéMON powerful.

And, at last, I've
been accepted into
the ELITE FOUR.

I can only keep
getting better!

Losing is not an
option!


I... I can't...
believe it...


Even though I was
defeated, I won't
change my course.

I will continue
battling until I

stand above all
trainers!

Now, {A1}, move
on and experience

the true ferocity
of the ELITE FOUR.






Fwahahahaha!

I am KOGA of the
ELITE FOUR.

I live in shadows,
a ninja!

My intricate style
will confound and
destroy you!

Confusion, sleep,
poison...

Prepare to be the
victim of my sin-
ister technique!

Fwahahahaha!

POKéMON is not
merely about brute

force--you shall
see soon enough!


Ah!
You have proven
your worth!


I subjected you to
everything I could
muster.

But my efforts
failed. I must
hone my skills.

Go on to the next
room, and put your
abilities to test!






I am BRUNO of the
ELITE FOUR.

I always train to
the extreme be-
cause I believe in
our potential.

That is how we
became strong.

Can you withstand
our power?

Hm? I see no fear
in you. You look

determined. Per-
fect for battle!

Ready, {A1}?
You will bow down

to our overwhelm-
ing power!

Hoo hah!


Why? How could we
lose?


Having lost, I
have no right to
say anything...

Go face your next
challenge!






I am KAREN of the
ELITE FOUR.

You're {A1}?
How amusing.

I love dark-type
POKéMON.

I find their wild,
tough image to be

so appealing. And
they're so strong.

Think you can take
them? Just try to
entertain me.

Let's go.


Well, aren't you
good. I like that
in a trainer.


Strong POKéMON.

Weak POKéMON.

That is only the
selfish perception
of people.

Truly skilled
trainers should

try to win with
their favorites.

I like your style.
You understand
what's important.

Go on--the CHAM-
PION is waiting.






LANCE: I've been
waiting for you.

{14}!

I knew that you,
with your skills,

would eventually
reach me here.

There's no need
for words now.

We will battle to
determine who is

the stronger of
the two of us.

As the most power-
ful trainer and as

the POKéMON LEAGUE
CHAMPION...

I, LANCE the drag-
on master, accept
your challenge!


...It's over.

But it's an odd
feeling.

I'm not angry that
I lost. In fact, I
feel happy.

Happy that I
witnessed the rise

of a great new
CHAMPION!


...Whew.

You have become
truly powerful,
{14}.

Your POKéMON have
responded to your

strong and up-
standing nature.

As a trainer, you
will continue to

grow strong with
your POKéMON.


MARY: Oh, no!
It's all over!

PROF.OAK, if you
weren't so slow...


PROF.OAK: Ah,
{14}!

It's been a long
while.

You certainly look
more impressive.

Your conquest of
the LEAGUE is just
fantastic!

Your dedication,
trust and love for

your POKéMON made
this happen.

Your POKéMON were
outstanding too.

Because they be-
lieved in you as a

trainer, they per-
severed.

Congratulations,
{14}!


MARY: Let's inter-
view the brand new
CHAMPION!


LANCE: This is
getting to be a
bit too noisy...

{14}, could you
come with me?


MARY: Oh, wait!
We haven't done
the interview!






LANCE: It's been a
long time since I
last came here.

This is where we
honor the LEAGUE

CHAMPIONS for all
eternity.

Their courageous
POKéMON are also
inducted.

Here today, we
witnessed the rise

of a new LEAGUE
CHAMPION--a

trainer who feels
compassion for,

and trust toward,
all POKéMON.

A trainer who
succeeded through

perseverance and
determination.

The new LEAGUE
CHAMPION who has

all the makings
of greatness!

{14}, allow me
to register you

and your partners
as CHAMPIONS!




SEED

While it is young,
it uses the
nutrients that are

stored in the
seeds on its back
in order to grow.


SEED

The bulb on its
back grows as it
absorbs nutrients.

The bulb gives off
a pleasant aroma
when it blooms.


SEED

As it warms it-
self and absorbs
the sunlight, its

flower petals
release a pleasant
fragrance.


LIZARD

If it's healthy,
the flame on the
tip of its tail

will burn vigor-
ously, even if it
gets a bit wet.


FLAME

If it becomes
agitated during
battle, it spouts

intense flames,
incinerating its
surroundings.


FLAME

It uses its wings
to fly high. The
temperature of its

fire increases as
it gains exper-
ience in battle.


TINYTURTLE

When it feels
threatened, it
draws its legs

inside its shell
and sprays water
from its mouth.


TURTLE

Its long, furry
tail is a symbol
of longevity,

making it quite
popular among
older people.


SHELLFISH

It firmly plants
its feet on the
ground before

shooting water
from the jets on
its back.


WORM

It crawls into
foliage where it
camouflages itself

among leaves that
are the same color
as its body.


COCOON

This is its pre-
evolved form. At
this stage, it can

only harden, so it
remains motionless
to avoid attack.


BUTTERFLY

It flits from
flower to flower,
collecting honey.

It can even
identify distant
flowers in bloom.


HAIRY BUG

The barb on top of
its head secretes
a strong poison.

It uses this toxic
barb to protect
itself.


COCOON

Nearly incapable
of movement, it
leans against

stout trees while
waiting for its
evolution.


POISON BEE

It uses sharp,
poisonous stings
to defeat prey,

then takes the
victim back to its
nest for food.


TINY BIRD

It rapidly flaps
its wings in the
grass, stirring up

a dust cloud that
drives insect prey
out into the open.


BIRD

It slowly flies in
a circular pat-
tern, all the

while keeping a
sharp lookout for
prey.


BIRD

Its outstanding
vision allows it
to spot splashing

MAGIKARP, even
while flying at
3300 feet.


RAT

This POKéMON's
impressive vital-
ity allows it to

live anywhere. It
also multiplies
very quickly.


RAT

The webs on its
hind legs enable
it to cross

rivers. It search-
es wide areas for
food.


TINY BIRD

To protect its
territory, it
flies around

ceaselessly,
making high-
pitched cries.


BEAK

It uses its long
beak to attack. It
has a surprisingly

long reach, so it
must be treated
with caution.


SNAKE

It flutters the
tip of its tongue
to seek out the

scent of prey,
then swallows the
prey whole.


COBRA

To intimidate
foes, it spreads
its chest wide and

makes eerie sounds
by expelling air
from its mouth.


MOUSE

When it is anger-
ed, it immediately
discharges the

energy stored in
the pouches in its
cheeks.


MOUSE

If its electric
pouches run empty,
it raises its tail

to gather electri-
city from the
atmosphere.


MOUSE

It prefers dry,
sandy places
because it uses

the sand to
protect itself
when threatened.


MOUSE

Adept at climbing
trees, it rolls
into a spiny ball,

then attacks its
enemies from
above.


POISON PIN

Small and very
docile, it pro-
tects itself with

its small, poison-
ous horn when
attacked.


POISON PIN

It has a docile
nature. If it is
threatened with

attack, it raises
the barbs that are
all over its body.


DRILL

The hard scales
that cover its
strong body serve

as excellent
protection from
any attack.


POISON PIN

It constantly
moves its large
ears in many

directions in
order to detect
danger right away.


POISON PIN

It is easily
agitated and uses
its horn for

offense as soon as
it notices an
attacker.


DRILL

It uses its thick
arms, legs and
tail to attack

forcefully. Melee
combat is its
specialty.


FAIRY

Though rarely
seen, it becomes
easier to spot,

for some reason,
on the night of a 
full moon.


FAIRY

Said to live in
quiet, remote
mountains, this

type of fairy has
a strong aversion
to being seen.


FOX

As its body grows
larger, its six
warm tails become

more beautiful,
with a more luxur-
ious coat of fur.


FOX

It is said to live
a thousand years,
and each of its

tails is loaded
with supernatural
powers.


BALLOON

It rolls its cute
eyes as it sings a
soothing lullaby.

Its gentle song
puts anyone who
hears it to sleep.


BALLOON

The rich, fluffy
fur that covers
its body feels so

good that anyone
who feels it can't
stop touching it.


BAT

During the day, it
gathers with
others and hangs

from the ceilings
of old buildings
and caves.


BAT

When it plunges
its fangs into its
prey, it instantly

draws and gulps
down more than ten
ounces of blood.


WEED

During the day, it
stays in the cold
underground to

avoid the sun.
It grows by bath-
ing in moonlight.


WEED

The smell from its
drool-like syrup
and the pollen on

its petals is so
bad, it may make
opponents faint.


FLOWER

By shaking its big
petals, it scat-
ters toxic pollen

into the air,
turning the air
yellow.


MUSHROOM

The tochukaso
growing on this
POKéMON's back

orders it to
extract juice from
tree trunks.


MUSHROOM

When nothing's
left to extract
from the bug, the

mushrooms on its
back leave spores
on the bug's egg.


INSECT

The small bugs it
eats appear only
at night, so it

sleeps in a hole
in a tree until
night falls.


POISONMOTH

The scales it
scatters will
paralyze anyone

who touches them,
making that person
unable to stand.


MOLE

It digs under-
ground and chews
on tree roots,

sticking its head
out only when the
sun isn't bright.


MOLE

These DIGLETT
triplets dig over
60 miles below sea

level. No one
knows what it's
like underground.


SCRATCHCAT

It loves things
that sparkle. When
it sees a shiny

object, the gold
coin on its head
shines too.


CLASSY CAT

Behind its lithe,
elegant appearance
lies a barbaric

side. It will tear
apart its prey on
a mere whim.


DUCK

The only time it
can use its psy-
chic power is when

its sleeping brain
cells happen to
wake.


DUCK

It swims grace-
fully along on the
quiet, slow-moving

rivers and lakes
of which it is so
fond.


PIG MONKEY

It lives in groups
in the treetops.
If it loses sight

of its group, it
becomes infuriated
by its loneliness.


PIG MONKEY

It will beat up
anyone who makes
it mad, even if it

has to chase them
until the end of
the world.


PUPPY

It controls a big
territory. If it
detects an unknown

smell, it roars
loudly to force
out the intruder.


LEGENDARY

An ancient picture
scroll shows that
people were

attracted to its
movement as it ran
through prairies.


TADPOLE

The swirl on its
belly is its
insides showing

through the skin.
It looks clearer
after it eats.


TADPOLE

Though it is
skilled at walk-
ing, it prefers to

live underwater
where there is
less danger.


TADPOLE

It can use its
well-developed
arms and legs to

run on the surface
of the water for a
split second.


PSI

It hypnotizes
itself so that it
can teleport away

when it senses
danger, even
if it is asleep.


PSI

When it closes its
eyes, twice as
many alpha parti-

cles come out of
the surface of its
body.






KANTO's POWER
PLANT?

It's near the end
of ROUTE 9, the

road that heads
east from here.

I think there was
an accident of
some sort there.


You're collecting
every single kind
of POKéMON?

That must be quite
a challenge, but
it sounds fun too.


The CAPE in the
north is a good

place for dates.
Girls like it!


SLOWBRO: Yarah?


My SLOWBRO and I
make an awesome
combination!


SLOWBRO, show me
your CONFUSION!


...


I'm a huge fan of
CERULEAN GYM's
MISTY.


I saw this shady
guy go off toward
CERULEAN's CAPE.


There used to be a
cave here that had

horribly powerful
POKéMON in it.


Ayuh?

My ITEMFINDER is
responding...


CERULEAN CITY

A Mysterious Blue
Aura Surrounds It


CERULEAN CITY
POKéMON GYM
LEADER: MISTY

The Tomboyish
Mermaid


There's a notice
here...

The BIKE SHOP has
moved to GOLDENROD
CITY in JOHTO...


There's a notice
here...

Stamp out thievery
and make the city

a friendlier, more
cheerful place!

CERULEAN POLICE


CERULEAN CAPE
AHEAD


It's locked...






We stand guard in
this tower.

Here, we express
our gratitude to
honor all POKéMON.


Th-Thank you!


All living beings
coexist through
cooperation.

We must always be
thankful for this.


Only if you reach
the top will you
obtain an HM.


SPROUT TOWER was
built long ago

as a place for
POKéMON training.


A BELLSPROUT over
100 feet tall...

People say that it
became the center
pillar here.


See the pillar
shaking?

People are train-
ing upstairs.


A POKéMON statue...

It looks very
distinguished.






However hard we
battle, the TOWER
will stand strong.


I fought hard but
I'm too weak.


The flexible pil-
lar protects the

TOWER, even from
earthquakes.


...Sway like leaves
in the wind...


Oh, I'm weak!


I tried to copy
BELLSPROUT's

gentle movements
for battle...

But I didn't train
well enough.


A POKéMON statue...

It looks very
distinguished.






ELDER: You are in-
deed skilled as a
trainer.

As promised, here
is your HM.

But let me say
this: You should

treat your
POKéMON better.

The way you battle
is far too harsh.

POKéMON are not
tools of war...


...
...Humph!

He claims to be
the ELDER but
he's weak.

It stands to
reason.

I'd never lose to
fools who babble

about being nice
to POKéMON.

I only care about
strong POKéMON
that can win.

I really couldn't
care less about
weak POKéMON.


{A2} used an
ESCAPE ROPE!


So good of you to
come here!

SPROUT TOWER is a
place of training.

People and POKéMON
test their bonds

to build a bright
future together.

I am the final
test.

Allow me to check
the ties between

your POKéMON and
you!


Ah, excellent!


You and your POKé-
MON should have

no problem using
this move.

Take this FLASH
HM.


FLASH illuminates
even the darkest
of all places.

But to use it out
of battle, you

need the BADGE
from VIOLET's GYM.


I hope you learn
and grow from your
journey.


I train to find
enlightenment in
POKéMON!


My training is
incomplete...


As POKéMON grow
stronger, so does
the trainer.

No, wait. As the
trainer grows

stronger, so do
the POKéMON.


Let me see how
much you trust
your POKéMON.


Yes, your trust is
real!


It is not far to
the ELDER.


The ELDER's HM
lights even pitch-
black darkness.


It is my head that
is bright!


Let there be light
on your journey.


It's a powerful
painting of a
BELLSPROUT.


A POKéMON statue...

It looks very
distinguished.






EUSINE: Awesome!
Too awesome, even!

I've never seen a
battle that great.

That was truly
inspiring to see.

SUICUNE was tough,
but you were even

more incredible,
{A1}.

I heard SUICUNE's
mystic power

summons a rainbow-
colored POKéMON.

Maybe, just maybe,
what went on today

will cause that
POKéMON to appear.

I'm going to study
the legends more.

Thanks for showing
me that fantastic
battle.

Later, {A1}!


According to
legend...

When the souls of
POKéMON and humans

commune, from the
heavens descends a

POKéMON of rainbow
colors...

Could it mean the
legendary POKéMON

are testing us
humans?


When the BRASS
TOWER burned down,

three nameless
POKéMON were said

to have perished.
It was tragic.

However...

A rainbow-colored
POKéMON...

In other words...

HO-OH descended
from the sky and

gave new life to
the three POKéMON.

They are...

SUICUNE, ENTEI and
RAIKOU.

That is what they
say.


The two TOWERS are
said to have been

built to foster
friendship and

hope between POKé-
MON and people.

That was 700 years
ago, but the ideal

still remains
important today.


HO-OH appears to
have descended

upon this, the TIN
TOWER!


This will protect
you. Take it.


Now, go.


I believe you are
being tested.

Free your mind
from uncertainty,
and advance.


I knew it.

I knew you'd get
to see the POKéMON

of rainbow colors,
{A1}.

It happened just
as I envisioned.

My research isn't
bad, I might say.

I'm going to keep
studying POKéMON

to become a famous
POKéMANIAC!


The legendary
POKéMON are said

to embody three
powers...

The lightning that
struck the TOWER.

The fire that
burned the TOWER.

And the rain that
put out the fire...


When the legendary
POKéMON appeared...

They struck terror
in those who saw
their rise.

And...

Some even took to
futile attacks.

The legendary
POKéMON, knowing

their own power,
fled, ignoring the
frightened people.


Of the legendary
POKéMON, SUICUNE

is said to be the
closest to HO-OH.

I hear there may
also be a link to

POKéMON known as
UNOWN.

The POKéMON UNOWN
must be sharing a

cooperative bond
with SUICUNE.






...... ...... ......

...Oh, it's you.

I came looking for
some legendary

POKéMON that they
say roosts here.

But there's
nothing here!

Nothing after all
the trouble of

coming to this
dump? No way!

It's all your
fault!


...Humph!

This is why I hate
battling wimps.

There's no
challenge in it.


...Aw, whatever.

You would never be
able to catch a

legendary POKéMON
anyway.


...Humph!

This is why I hate
battling wimps.

It's just a waste
of my time.


Humph!

What are you doing
falling into a

hole? Some genius
you are!

Serves you right!


EUSINE: My name's
EUSINE.

I'm on the trail
of a POKéMON named
SUICUNE.

And you are...?

{A1}? Glad to
meet you!

I heard rumors
that SUICUNE is in

this BURNED TOWER,
so I came to look.

But where exactly
could it be?


EUSINE: I heard
that SUICUNE is in

this BURNED TOWER,
so I came to look.

But where exactly
could it be?


MORTY: ECRUTEAK's
GYM LEADER has to

study what are
said to be the

legendary POKéMON
--SUICUNE, ENTEI
and RAIKOU.

EUSINE is here, so
I've decided to

investigate the
TOWER with him.






EUSINE: I dug a
hole here, too...

I was shocked!

SUICUNE raced by
like a blur, right

in front of my
eyes!

For ten years I
chased SUICUNE,

and I finally got
to see it.

I'm all choked up!

{A1}, I owe
this all to you!

Thank you!

I heard that the
legendary POKéMON

of ECRUTEAK test
chosen humans by

allowing them to
get close.

I'm going to track
SUICUNE.

{A1}, let's
meet again!

Farewell!






Are you collecting
KANTO GYM BADGES?






I heard that some
shady character is
skulking about.

I won't stand for
it if he turns out
to be a thief.


We were held up by
robbers before.


DIGLETT: Dug dug.






My husband lives
happily with POKé-
MON he got through
trades.


Ah... I'm so happy...


KANGASKHAN: Garu
garuu.


ZUBAT: Zuba zubaa.






For battles, I'd
much rather use

POKéMON I've been
raising, even if

they're weaker
than some newly
caught POKéMON.


Do you battle by
mobile phone?

If time runs out
during a battle,

waiting to see who
won is really
nerve wracking.


The MAGNET TRAIN
travels at over

340 mph. It goes
between KANTO and

JOHTO in almost no
time at all.

It really makes
JOHTO accessible.






Oops! I so sorry!
You not hurt,
okay?

I very busy.
No time for talk-
ing with you. Not
good for me if
seen by somebody.


Oh no! You seen
me already! I make
big mistake!


Hey, you! Forget
you see me, okay?

You see, hear,
know nothing,

okay?
Bye, kid! Nothing!

Bye-bye a go-go!


Sorry, I'll be out
for a while.
MISTY, GYM LEADER


Since MISTY's out,
we'll be away too.
GYM TRAINERS


MISTY: I was ex-
pecting you, you
pest!

You may have a
lot of JOHTO GYM

BADGES, but you'd
better not take me
too lightly.

My water-type
POKéMON are tough!


MISTY: You really
are good...

I'll admit that
you are skilled...

Here you go. It's
CASCADEBADGE.


{A1} received
CASCADEBADGE.


MISTY: Are there
many strong train-
ers in JOHTO? Like
you, I mean.

I'm going to
travel one day, so

I can battle some
skilled trainers.


Sorry about being
away. Let's get on
with it!


I give up! You're
the winner!


I'll be swimming
quietly.


Don't let my ele-
gant swimming un-
nerve you.


Ooh, you calmly
disposed of me...


Don't be too smug
about beating me.

MISTY will destroy
you if you get
complacent.


Glub...

I'm first! Come
and get me!


This can't be...


MISTY has gotten
much better in the
past few years.

Don't let your
guard down, or
you'll be crushed!


Yo! CHAMP in
making!

Since MISTY was
away, I went out

for some fun too.
He-he-he.


Hoo, you showed me
how tough you are.

As always, that
was one heck of a
great battle!






You'll run into
many trainers on

the way to CERU-
LEAN's CAPE.

They want to see
how they stack

up against other
trainers.


MISTY is about the
only person in

town who can beat
the trainers at
CERULEAN's CAPE.






A POKéMON CENTER
near a cave?

That's mighty
convenient.


The POWER PLANT's
MANAGER is looking

for a strong POKé-
MON trainer.

He needs help
getting back

something that
was stolen.


I hear TEAM ROCKET
got back together

in JOHTO but fell
apart right away.

I didn't know any-
thing about that.


When you go out-
side, you can see

the roof of a big
building.

That's the POWER
PLANT.






A thief broke into
the POWER PLANT...

What is the world
coming to?


I just got word
from CERULEAN.

It appears that a
shady character

has been loitering
around.


Could I ask for
your cooperation?


We'll have to beef
up our security
presence.


Someone made off
with a part that's

essential for the
generator.

Without it, the
new generator's
useless!


The generator's up
and running. It's

making electricity
to spare.


This POWER PLANT
had been abandoned
in the past.

We got it back up
and running to

provide power to
the MAGNET TRAIN.


The generator's
running again!


The POWER PLANT's
MANAGER is up
ahead.

But since someone
wrecked the gener-
ator, he's been
both sad and
furious...


Since the gener-
ator's been fixed,

the MANAGER has
been cheerful.


The MAGNET TRAIN
consumes a lot of
electricity.

It can't move if
the new generator
isn't operating.


All right! We can
finally get the

MAGNET TRAIN
running again.


MANAGER: I, I, I'm
ready to blast
someone!

Who would dare
ruin my generator?

I spent so much
time on it!

If I catch him,
he's going to get

a taste of my ZAP
CANNON!


MANAGER: I won't
forgive him!

The culprit can
cry and apologize,

but I'll still
hammer him!

Gahahahah!


MANAGER: Ah! Yeah!

That's the missing
PART from my be-
loved generator!
You found it?


Wahah! Thanks!

Here! Take this TM
as a reward!


MANAGER: TM07 is
my ZAP CANNON.

It's a powerful
technique!

It's not what any-
one would consider

accurate, but it
packs a wallop!


MANAGER: My be-
loved generator!

Keep pumping the
electricity out!






Hm? You know BILL?
He's my grandson.

He's in JOHTO. He
does something

with PCs, so I'm
house-sitting.


If you have that
POKéMON, may I see
it, please?


You will show me?
How good of you!


You don't have it?
That's too bad...


Ah, so that is
?

Isn't it cute!
That's so kind of
you.


Thanks!

This is a token of
my appreciation.


Come visit again
sometime.


Thanks for showing
me so many cute
POKéMON.

I really enjoyed
myself. I'm glad

I've lived such a
long life.


Hm?

That's not the
POKéMON that I was
told about.


My grandson BILL
told me about a

POKéMON that has a
long tongue.


Ah, my grandson
mentioned a round,

green POKéMON that
has leaves growing
on its head.


Do you know of a
sea POKéMON that

has a red sphere
in its body?

You know, the one
that's shaped like
a star?

I heard that it
appears at night.

I would surely
like to see it.


BILL told me about
a POKéMON that is

very loyal to its
trainer.

It's supposed to
ROAR well.


I heard about a
cute POKéMON that
has six tails.

I would love to
hug a cute POKéMON
like that.


Do you know that
hugely popular
POKéMON?

The POKéMON that
has a yellow body
and red cheeks.

I would love to
see what it looks

like before it
evolves.






Hello!

KARATE KING, the
FIGHTING DOJO's

master, is in a
cave in JOHTO for
training.


What goes around
comes around!


Enemies on every
side!








SABRINA: I knew
you were coming...

Three years ago I
had a vision of
your arrival.

You're after my
BADGE.

I don't enjoy bat-
tling, but it's my

duty as a LEADER
to confer BADGES

on anyone who has
proven him- or
herself worthy.

Since you wish it,
I will show you my
psychic powers!


SABRINA: Your
power...

It far exceeds
what I foresaw...

Maybe it isn't
possible to fully

predict what the
future holds...

OK, you win. You
earned yourself
MARSHBADGE.


{A1} received
MARSHBADGE.


SABRINA: MARSH-
BADGE draws out

your subliminal
powers...

Although I failed
to accurately pre-
dict your power,
this much I know
to be true.

You will become a
celebrated and
beloved CHAMPION!


SABRINA: Your love
for your POKéMON

overwhelmed my
psychic power...

The power of love,
I think, is also a

kind of psychic
power...


The power of all
those you defeated
comes to me!


Strong...
Far too strong...


What is the source
of your power?


Psychic power is
the power of your
soul.


Your soul has more
power than mine!


You made your soul
stronger, not just
your abilities.


Fufufufu...
I see it clearly.

I can see into
your soul!


Though I read you,
I still lost...


Darn! I forgot
that I predicted I

The FIGHTING DOJO
next door was once
this city's GYM.


I was no match...


KARATE KING, the
master of the

FIGHTING DOJO, was
just destroyed by
SABRINA.


Yo, CHAMP in
making!

A trainer as
skilled as you

doesn't need to be
told how to deal

with psychic-type
POKéMON, right?

I expect great
things from you!

Good luck!


That was another
fantastic battle!






There's a big
RADIO TOWER in
LAVENDER.


I want to become
stronger, but I'm
not good yet...

Could you show me
how sometime?






What are JOHTO's
POKéMON CENTERS
like?

...Oh, I see. So
they're not much

different from the
ones in KANTO.

I can go to JOHTO
without worrying,
then!


What are JOHTO's
POKéMON CENTERS
like?

...Oh, I see.
So they let you

link with people
far away?

Then I'll get my
friend in JOHTO to

catch a MARILL and
trade it to me!


I just happened to
come through ROCK

TUNNEL. There was
some commotion at
the POWER PLANT.


Caves collapse
easily.

Several caves have
disappeared in the

past few years,
like the one out-
side CERULEAN.

As a pro HIKER,
that's common
knowledge.


SILPH CO.'s HEAD
OFFICE and the

MAGNET TRAIN STA-
TION--they're the

places to see in
SAFFRON.








...

...

...

...I got it!

You wanted this!


TM29 is PSYCHIC.

It may lower the
target's SPCL.DEF.






I'm sorry, but the
MAGNET TRAIN isn't
operating now.


We'll soon depart
for GOLDENROD.

Are you coming on
board?


May I see your
rail PASS, please?

OK. Right this
way, please.


Sorry, but you
don't have a PASS.


We hope to see you
again.


We have arrived in
SAFFRON.

We hope to see you
again.


The MAGNET TRAIN
is a super-modern

rail liner that
uses electricity

and magnets to
attain incredible
speed.

However, if there
isn't any elec-
tricity...


Whew...

How many times
have I gone back

and forth between
KANTO and JOHTO?


Before the MAGNET
TRAIN STATION was

built, there was a
house there.

A little girl
named COPYCAT used
to live there.


Hi. Do you have a
rail PASS? I have

one. All the peo-
ple in SAFFRON who

ride the MAGNET
TRAIN have PASSES.






Welcome. This is
SILPH CO.'s HEAD
OFFICE BUILDING.


Only employees are
permitted to go
upstairs.

But since you came
such a long way,

have this neat
little souvenir.


It's SILPH CO.'s
latest product.

It's not for sale
anywhere yet.






My daughter likes
to mimic people.

Her mimicry has
earned her the

nickname COPYCAT
around here.


My daughter is so
self-centered...

She only has a few
friends.


She recently lost
the POKé DOLL that

a boy gave her
three years ago.

Ever since then,
she's gotten even
better at mimicry...


BLISSEY: Bliisii!






{A1}: Hi! Do
you like POKéMON?

{A1}: Uh, no, I
just asked you.

{A1}: Huh?
You're strange!


COPYCAT: Hmm?
Quit mimicking?

But that's my
favorite hobby!


{A1}: Hi!
I heard that you

lost your favorite
POKé DOLL.

{A1}: If I find
it, you'll give me
a rail PASS?

{A1}: I'll go
find it for you.

You think you lost
it when you went
to VERMILION CITY?


COPYCAT: Pardon?

I shouldn't decide
what you should
do?

But I'm really
worried... What if
someone finds it?


COPYCAT: Yay!
That's my CLEFAIRY
POKé DOLL!

See the tear where
the right leg is

sewn on? That's
proof!


OK. Here's the
MAGNET TRAIN PASS
like I promised!


COPYCAT: That's
the PASS for the
MAGNET TRAIN.

The rail company
man gave me that

when they tore
down our old house
for the STATION.


{A1}: Hi!
Thanks a lot for
the rail PASS!

{A1}: Pardon?

{A1}: Is it
that fun to mimic
my every move?


COPYCAT: You bet!
It's a scream!


{A1}: Hi. You
must like POKéMON.

{A1}: No, not
me. I asked you.

{A1}: Pardon?
You're weird!


{A1}: Hi. Did
you really lose
your POKé DOLL?

{A1}: You'll
really give me a

rail PASS if I
find it for you?

{A1}: Sure,
I'll look for it!

You think you lost
it when you were
in VERMILION?


{A1}: Thank you
for the rail PASS!

{A1}: ...Pardon?

{A1}: Is it
really that fun to

copy what I say
and do?


DODRIO: Gii giii!


MIRROR, MIRROR ON
THE WALL, WHO'S

THE FAIREST ONE OF
ALL?


This is a rare
POKéMON! Huh?

It's only a doll...




Many cities in
JOHTO have long

histories. I'd
love to visit!






You're from JOHTO,
aren't you?

How do you like
KANTO? It's nice,
don't you agree?




Eeyaaaah!

I sense a sinister
shadow hovering
over you.

Take this to ward
it off!


You were in mortal
danger, but you
are protected now.


My grandma is into
warding off what

she believes to be
evil spirits.

I'm sorry that she
startled you.




Have you visited
PEWTER GYM?

The LEADER uses
rock-type POKéMON.


At night, CLEFAIRY
come out to play
at MT.MOON.

But not every
night.


Ah, you came all
the way out here
from JOHTO?

That brings back
memories. When I

was young, I went
to JOHTO to train.

You remind me so
much of what I was

like as a young
man.

Here. I want you
to have this item
I found in JOHTO.


Going to new, un-
known places and
seeing new people...

Those are the joys
of travel.

WELCOME TO

Whoa! You startled
me there!

I had my BLACK-
GLASSES on, so I

didn't notice you
at all.

What am I doing
here?

Hey, don't you
worry about it.

I'll give you a
pair of BLACK-
GLASSES, so forget
you saw me, OK?


BLACKGLASSES ups

Wait!


CLAIR: I'm sorry
about this.

Here, take this as
my apology.


{A1} received
TM24.


That contains
DRAGONBREATH.

No, it doesn't
have anything to
do with my breath.

If you don't want
it, you don't have
to take it.


Oh? You don't have
any room for this.

I'm going back to
the GYM, so make

room, then come
see me there.


CLAIR: What's the
matter? Aren't you

going on to the
POKéMON LEAGUE?

Do you know how to
get there?

From here, go to
NEW BARK TOWN.

Then SURF east to
POKéMON LEAGUE.

The route there is
very tough.

Don't you dare
lose at the POKé-
MON LEAGUE!

If you do, I'll
feel even worse

about having lost
to you!

Give it everything
you've got.


DRAGON SHRINE

A shrine honoring
the dragon POKéMON

said to have lived
in DRAGON'S DEN.


...
What? {A1}?

...No, I won't
battle you now...

My POKéMON aren't
ready to beat you.

I can't push them
too hard now.

I have to be dis-
ciplined to become

the greatest POKé-
MON trainer...


...

Whew...

Learn to stay out
of my way...


You! How dare you
enter uninvited!


S-strong!


The SHRINE ahead
is home to the

MASTER of our
dragon-user clan.

You're not allowed
to just go in!


You shouldn't be
in here!


Oh yikes, I lost!


Soon I'm going to
get permission

from our MASTER to
use dragons.

When I do, I'm
going to become an

admirable dragon
trainer and gain

our MASTER's
approval.


It's a stranger we
don't know.


Ouchies.


It was like having
to battle LANCE.


Who are you?

We'll tell on you.

Hm... Good to see
you here.

No need to explain
why you came.

CLAIR sent you
here, didn't she?

That girl is a
handful...

I am sorry, but I
must test you.

Not to worry, you
are to answer only
a few questions.

Ready?


What are POKéMON
to you?


What helps you to
win battles?


What kind of
trainer do you
wish to battle?


What is most
important for
raising POKéMON?


Strong POKéMON.
Weak POKéMON.

Which is more
important?


Hm... I see...

You care deeply
for POKéMON.

Very commendable.

That conviction is
what is important!

{A1}, don't
lose that belief.

It will see you
through at the
POKéMON LEAGUE.


CLAIR!

This child is
impeccable, in
skill and spirit!

Admit defeat and
confer the RISING-
BADGE!

...Or must I inform
LANCE of this?


CLAIR...

Reflect upon what
it is that you

lack and this
child has.


Come again, if you
so desire.


Hm... Good to see
you here.

Your arrival is
most fortunate.

I have something
for you.

Take this DRATINI
as proof that I

have recognized
your worth.


{A1} received
DRATINI!


Hm? Your POKéMON
party is full.


Dragon POKéMON are
symbolic of our
clan.

You have shown
that you can be

entrusted with
one.


CLAIR appears to
have learned an

invaluable lesson
from you.

I thank you as her
grandfather.


A boy close to
your age is in
training here.

He is much like
CLAIR when she was

younger. It is a
little worrisome...


Hah? I didn't
quite catch that...


What was it you
said?


Oh, I understand...


It's been quite
some time since a

trainer has gained
our MASTER's rare
approval.

In fact, not since
Master LANCE.


You know young
Master LANCE?

He looks so much
like our MASTER
did in his youth.

It's in their
blood.


So how did it go?

I guess there's no
point in asking.

You did fail?

....................................

...What? You passed?


That can't be!


You're lying!

Even I haven't
been approved!


I-I understand...


Here, this is the
RISINGBADGE...

Hurry up! Take it!


{A1} received
RISINGBADGE.


RISINGBADGE will
enable your

POKéMON to use the
move for climbing
waterfalls.

Also, all POKéMON
will recognize you

as a trainer and
obey your every

command without
question.




Do your POKéMON
know HM moves?

Those moves can
be used even if

your POKéMON has
fainted.


This BILL guy
created the system

for storing
POKéMON in a PC.

BILL's PC can
store up to 20
POKéMON per BOX.


BILL's PC can
store up to 20
POKéMON per BOX.


Do you know about
APRICORNS?

Crack one open,
hollow it out and

fit it with a
special device.

Then you can catch
POKéMON with it.

Before POKé BALLS
were invented,

everyone used
APRICORNS.




All the SLOWPOKE
have disappeared
from the town.

The forest's pro-
tector may be
angry with us...

It may be a bad
omen. We should
stay in.


The SLOWPOKE have
returned...

But my APPRENTICE
hasn't come back
from ILEX FOREST.

Where in the world
is that lazy guy?


You chased off
TEAM ROCKET and

went to ILEX
FOREST alone?

That takes guts!
I like that. Come
train with us.


Where have all the
SLOWPOKE gone?

Are they out play-
ing somewhere?


I'm sorry--I for-
got to thank you.

This is CHARCOAL
that I made.

Fire-type POKéMON
would be happy to
hold that.


The SLOWPOKE came
back, and you even
found FARFETCH'D.

You're the cool-
est, man!


FARFETCH'D: Kwaa!




There's no GREAT
BALL here. POKé

BALLS will have
to do.

I wish KURT would
make me some of
his custom BALLS.


A GREAT BALL is
better for catch-
ing POKéMON than a
POKé BALL.

But KURT's might
be better some-
times.




Hm? Who are you?

{A1}, eh? You
want me to make
some BALLS?

Sorry, but that'll
have to wait.

Do you know TEAM
ROCKET? Ah, don't

worry. I'll tell
you anyhow.

TEAM ROCKET's an
evil gang that

uses POKéMON for
their dirty work.

They're supposed
to have disbanded
three years ago.

Anyway, they're at
the WELL, cutting

off SLOWPOKETAILS
for sale!

So I'm going to
go give them a
lesson in pain!

Hang on, SLOWPOKE!
Old KURT is on his
way!


KURT: Hi, {A1}!

You handled your-
self like a real
hero at the WELL.

I like your style!

I would be honored
to make BALLS for

a trainer like
you.

This is all I have
now, but take it.


KURT: I make BALLS
from APRICORNS.

Collect them from
trees and bring
'em to me.

I'll make BALLS
out of them.


KURT: You have an
APRICORN for me?

Fine! I'll turn it
into a BALL.


KURT: It'll take a
day to make you a

BALL. Come back
for it later.


KURT: Oh...
That's a letdown.


KURT: I'm working!
Don't bother me!


KURT: Ah, {A1}!
I just finished
your BALL. Here!


KURT: That turned
out great.

Try catching
POKéMON with it.


KURT: Now that my
granddaughter is

helping me, I can
work much faster.


Wh-what is that?

I've never seen
one before.

It looks a lot
like a POKé BALL,

but it appears to
be something else.

Let me check it
for you.


I'm checking it
now.


Ah-ha! I see!
So...


{A1}!

This BALL started
to shake while I
was checking it.

There must be
something to this!


The SLOWPOKE are
gone... Were they

taken away by bad
people?


Grandpa's gone...
I'm so lonely...


The SLOWPOKE my
dad gave me came

back! Its TAIL is
growing back too!


Dad works at SILPH
where he studies
POKé BALLS.

I have to stay
home with Grandpa
and SLOWPOKE.


I get to help
Grandpa now!

We'll make good
BALLS for you, so
please wait!


It's fun to make
BALLS!


Grandpa's checking
a BALL right now.

So I'm waiting
till he's done.


SLOWPOKE: ...
Yawn?


...A young PROF.
OAK?


It's a statue of
the forest's pro-
tector.




I'm BUGSY!
I never lose when

it comes to bug
POKéMON.

My research is
going to make me

the authority on
bug POKéMON!

Let me demonstrate
what I've learned
from my studies.


Whoa, amazing!
You're an expert
on POKéMON!

My research isn't
complete yet.

OK, you win. Take
this BADGE.


{A1} received
HIVEBADGE.


Do you know the
benefits of HIVE-
BADGE?

If you have it,
POKéMON up to L30

will obey you,
even traded ones.

POKéMON that know
CUT will be able

to use it outside
of battle too.

Here, I also want
you to have this.


TM49 contains
FURY CUTTER.

If you don't miss,
it gets stronger
every turn.

The longer your
battle goes, the
better it gets.

Isn't that great?
I discovered it!


Bug POKéMON are
deep. There are

many mysteries to
be explored.

Study your favor-
ites thoroughly.


Bug POKéMON evolve
young. So they get

stronger that much
faster.


Just evolving
isn't enough!


POKéMON become
stronger if they
evolve. Really!


Bug POKéMON are
cool and tough!

I'll prove it to
you!


You proved how
tough you are...


They're so cool,
but most girls

don't like bug
POKéMON.

I don't know why...


You saved all the
SLOWPOKE? Whew,
you're mighty!

But my grown-up
POKéMON are pretty
tough too!


Urrgggh!


I guess I should
teach them better
moves...


AMY: Hi! Are you
challenging the
LEADER? No way!


AMY & MAY: Oh,
double goodness!


AMY: You're
really strong!


MAY: You want to
see the LEADER?
We come first!


AMY & MAY: Oh,
double goodness!


MAY: Our bug POKé-
MON lost! Oh, what
a shame.


Yo, challenger!

BUGSY's young, but
his knowledge of

bug POKéMON is for
real.

It's going to be
tough without my
advice.

Let's see... Bug
POKéMON don't like
fire.

Flying-type moves
are super-effec-
tive too.


Well done! That
was a great clash

of talented young
trainers.

With people like
you, the future of
POKéMON is bright!




Hiya, kid!

I see you're new
in MAHOGANY TOWN.

Since you're new,
you should try a

yummy RAGECANDY-
BAR!

Right now, it can
be yours for just
¥300! Want one?


Good! Savor it!


You don't have
enough money.


Oh, fine then...


You don't have
room for this.


RAGECANDYBAR's
sold out.

I'm packing up.
Don't bother me,
kiddo.


Are you off to see
the GYARADOS ram-
page at the LAKE?


MAGIKARP have
returned to LAKE
OF RAGE.

That should be
good news for the
anglers there.


Since you came
this far, take the

time to do some
sightseeing.

You should head
north and check

out LAKE OF RAGE
right now.


Visit Grandma's

What's the hurry?


{A1}, right?
Some guy wearing

glasses was look-
ing for you.

See for yourself.
He's waiting for

you at the POKéMON
CENTER.


Have you gone to
SPROUT TOWER?

If you ever visit
VIOLET CITY, 

they'll expect you
to train there.

That's basic for
trainers. Go to
SPROUT TOWER!


Have you gone to
the POKéMON GYM?

You can test your
POKéMON and your-
self there.

It's a rite of
passage for all
trainers!


You have some good
POKéMON there.

It must be from
the training you

gave them around
VIOLET CITY.

The training at
the GYM must have

been especially
helpful.

As a souvenir of
VIOLET CITY, take
this.

It increases the
power of grass-

Your experiences
in VIOLET CITY

should be useful
for your journey.


How would you like
to have this

tasty, nutritious
SLOWPOKETAIL?

For you right now,
just ¥1,000,000!

You'll want this!


Tch! I thought
kids these days
were loaded...


You don't want it?
Then scram. Shoo!


Whoa!

You made me lose
that fish!


Sploosh!


Calm, collected...
The essence of

fishing and POKé-
MON is the same.


I'm really good at
both fishing and
POKéMON.

I'm not about to
lose to any kid!


Tch! I tried to
rush things...


Fishing is a life-
long passion.

POKéMON are life-
long friends!


One, two, three...
Muahahaha, what a

great haul!
I'm done! Go ahead

and catch as many
as you can, kid!


I keep catching
the same POKéMON...

Maybe a battle
will turn things
around for me.


Nothing ever goes
right for me now...


How come the guy
next to me catches
good POKéMON?


Heh, I'm on a roll
today. How about a
battle, kid?


Oof. I wasn't
lucky that time.


You have to have a
good ROD if you

want to catch good
POKéMON.


My POKéMON?
Freshly caught!


SPLASH?


Freshly caught
POKéMON are no

match for properly
raised ones.


I haven't seen you
around before.

So you think you
are pretty tough?


You're strong!


I'm going to try
to be the best
with my favorites.

I'm not using the
same tough POKéMON
as everyone else.


I found some good
POKéMON in the
grass!

I think they'll do
it for me!


Darn. I thought I
could win.


The grass is full
of clingy things.


That glance...
It's intriguing.


Hmmm. This is
disappointing.


If you don't want
to battle, just
avoid eye contact.


Uh-huh. Yeah, and
you know...

Pardon? Battle?
I'm on the phone.

Oh, all right. But
make it fast.


Oh! I've got to
relieve my anger!


I was having a
nice chat too.


That BADGE! It's
from VIOLET CITY!

You beat FALKNER?


I know what my
weaknesses are.


I should train
again at the GYM
in VIOLET CITY.


The fishermen
yelled at me for
bugging them...


WROOOOAR!
PEOPLE RUN WHEN I

ROAR! BUT YOU
CAME LOOKING!

THAT PLEASES ME!
NOW TAKE THIS!


WROOOAR!
IT'S ROAR!

EVEN POKéMON RUN
FROM A GOOD ROAR!


FRIEDA: Yahoo!
It's Friday!

I'm FRIEDA of
Friday!

Nice to meet you!


Here's a POISON
BARB for you!


FRIEDA: Give it to
a POKéMON that has
poison-type moves.

Oh!

It's wicked!

You'll be shocked
how good it makes
poison moves!


FRIEDA: Hiya! What
day do you like?

I love Friday. No
doubt about it!

Don't you think
it's great too?

Thanks for hearing

to have this!


It's a RARE CANDY

I prefer making my

you can have it.


Hello, {14}!

Did you come see

No? Oh... I had more

real CLEFAIRY as
my friend.


Your PACK is
jammed full.


Look at my darling
BAYLEEF!

The leaf on its
head is so cute!


It's a CLEFAIRY!
Huh?

Oh, right. It's a
CLEFAIRY POKé
DOLL.


BAYLEEF: Li liif!


Let's all listen
politely to other
trainers.


If someone brags,
brag right back!






Do you know about
the MAGNET TRAIN?

It's a railway
that goes to GOL-
DENROD in JOHTO.


I want to go to
SAFFRON to see
the MAGNET TRAIN.






TEAM ROCKET is no
longer in KANTO.

That alone makes
me happy.


I'm thinking about
going shopping in
SAFFRON.





Over many years,
DIGLETT dug a
large tunnel.

That tunnel goes
to a distant town.








SURGE: Hey, you
little tyke!

I have to hand it
to you. It may not

be very smart to
challenge me, but
it takes guts!

When it comes to
electric POKéMON,
I'm number one!

I've never lost on
the battlefield.

I'll zap you just
like I did my
enemies in war!


SURGE: Arrrgh!
You are strong!

OK, kid. You get
THUNDERBADGE!


{A1} received
THUNDERBADGE.


SURGE: THUNDER-
BADGE increases
POKéMON's speed. 

Consider it proof
that you defeated

me. You wear it
proudly, hear?


SURGE: Hey, kid!
Still slugging and
chugging away?

My POKéMON and I
are still at it!


You're here to
defeat LT.SURGE?

Not if I can help
it!


Sorry I failed
you, LT.SURGE,
sir!


When I was still
in the army, LT.

SURGE saved my
life.


LT.SURGE recog-
nized my potential

with electric
POKéMON.

Think you can beat
me?


Ooh, how shocking!


If the GYM's traps
were working, you

would have been
toast...


I'm going to take
you down! Prepare
to be shocked!


Gwaaah!
I was overpowered...


Don't get too com-
fortable about

beating me...
LT.SURGE is tough.


Yo! CHAMP in
making!

You lucked out
this time.

LT.SURGE is very
cautious. He has

traps set all over
the GYM.

But--he-heh--the
traps aren't
active right now.

You'll have no
problem getting to
LT.SURGE.


Whew! That was an
electrifying bout!

It sure made me
nervous.


Nope! Nothing here
but trash.

It's a weird tree.
Use SQUIRTBOTTLE?


{A1} used the
SQUIRTBOTTLE.


The weird tree
doesn't like the
SQUIRTBOTTLE!

The weird tree
attacked!


I'm the FLOWER
SHOP's FLORIA!

Listen, listen!

When I sprinkled
water on that

wiggly tree, it
jumped right up!

It just has to be
a POKéMON.

I bet it would be
shocked out of its

disguise if you
soaked it!

I know! I'll tell
my sis and borrow
her water bottle!


When I told my sis
about the jiggly

tree, she said
it's dangerous.

If I beat WHITNEY,
I wonder if she'll

lend me her water
bottle...


Wa-hey!

I was going to
snap that tree

with my straight-
arm punch.

But I couldn't!
I'm a failure!


Did you clear that
wretched tree?

I'm impressed!
I want you to
have this.


{A1} received
TM08.


That happens to be
ROCK SMASH.

You can shatter
rocks with just a

single well-aimed
smack.

If any rocks are
in your way, just
smash 'em up!


An odd tree is
blocking the way

I wanted to go see
the huge POKéMON

CENTER they just
opened...


An odd tree is
blocking the way
to GOLDENROD CITY.

It's preventing
me from shopping.

Something should
be done about it.


That odd tree dis-
appeared without a
trace.

Oh! That tree was
really a POKéMON?


I'm going to read
your thoughts!


I misread you!


I'd be strong if
only I could tell

what my opponent
was thinking.


Thanks to my stud-
ies, I'm ready for
any POKéMON!


Oops! Computation
error?


Darn. I study five
hours a day too.

There's more to
learning than just
reading books.


ARTHUR: Who are
you?

I'm ARTHUR of
Thursday.


Here. You can have
this.


ARTHUR: A POKéMON
that uses rock-

type moves should
hold on to that.

It pumps up rock-
type attacks.


ARTHUR: I'm ARTHUR

the second son out
of seven children.


ARTHUR: Today's

TRAINER TIPS

POKéMON stats
vary--even within
the same species.

Their stats may be
similar at first.

However, differ-
ences will become

pronounced as the
POKéMON grow.


TRAINER TIPS

Use DIG to return
to the entrance of
any place.

It is convenient
for exploring

caves and other
landmarks.





One of the ELITE

The WARDEN is

Therefore, the
SAFARI ZONE is

No littering.

Please take your
waste with you.







I am CLAIR.

The world's best
dragon master.

I can hold my own
against even the

POKéMON LEAGUE's
ELITE FOUR.

Do you still want
to take me on?

...Fine.
Let's do it!

As a GYM LEADER,
I will use my full

power against any
opponent!


I lost?

I don't believe
it. There must be
some mistake...


I won't admit
this.

I may have lost,
but you're still

not ready for the
POKéMON LEAGUE.

I know. You should
take the dragon
user challenge.

Behind this GYM is
a place called
DRAGON'S DEN.

There is a small
shrine at its

center.
Go there.

If you can prove
that you've lost

your lazy ideals,
I will recognize

you as a trainer
worthy of a GYM
BADGE!


What's the matter?

Is it too much to
expect of you?


You've kept me
waiting!

Here! Take this!


{A1} received
TM24.


That contains
DRAGONBREATH.

No, it doesn't
have anything to
do with my breath.

If you don't want
it, you don't have
to take it.


What is this? You
don't have room?


What's the matter?

Aren't you headed
to the POKéMON
LEAGUE?

Don't you know
where it is?

From here, go to
NEW BARK TOWN.

Then SURF east.
The route there is
very tough.

Don't you dare
lose at the POKé-
MON LEAGUE!

If you do, I'll
feel even worse

about having lost
to you!

Give it every-
thing you've got.


Your first battle
against dragons?

I'll show you how
tough they are!


My dragon POKéMON
lost?


LANCE told you
that he'd like to

see you again?
Not a chance!


My chance of
losing? Not even
one percent!


That's odd.


I know my short-
comings now.

Thanks for showing
me!


Dragons are sacred
POKéMON.

They are full of
life energy.

If you're not
serious, you won't

be able to beat
them.


Way to go!


Dragons are weak
against dragon-
type moves.


Yo! CHAMP in
making!

It's been a long
journey, but we

are almost done!
Count on me!

CLAIR uses the
mythical and sac-
red dragon-type
POKéMON.

You can't damage
them very easily.

But you know,
they're supposed

to be weak against
ice-type moves.


You were great to
beat CLAIR!

All that's left is
the POKéMON LEAGUE
challenge.

You're on the way
to becoming the
POKéMON CHAMPION!





It's not as if we
all use dragon-
type POKéMON.


Rats! If only I
had a dragon!


Members of our
dragon-user clan

can use dragon
POKéMON only after

our MASTER allows
it.


I can't allow a
nameless trainer
past me!

CLAIR would be
livid if I did!


Awww... I lost...


Uh-oh... CLAIR is
going to be mad...


The boulder fell
through!








A clan of trainers
who can freely

command dragons
live right here in
BLACKTHORN.

As a result, there
are many legends

about dragons in
this town.


DRATINI: Draa!






You can't buy MAX
REVIVE, but it

fully restores a
fainted POKéMON.

Beware--it won't
restore PP, the

POWER POINTS
needed for moves.


MAX REPEL keeps
weak POKéMON away
from you.

It's the longest
lasting of the
REPEL sprays.








Deep inside far-
off INDIGO PLATEAU

is the POKéMON
LEAGUE.

I hear the best
trainers gather

there from around
the country.


There was this
move I just had

to teach my POKé-
MON.

So I got the MOVE
DELETER to make it
forget an HM move.






I was hoping to
buy some SAFARI

ZONE souvenirs,
but it's closed...


The SAFARI ZONE
WARDEN's grand-
daughter lives in

Fufufufu...

I'm sorry to dis-
appoint you...

I'm only joking!

I'm the real deal!

JANINE of FUCHSIA

JANINE: You're a

definitely won...

Here's SOULBADGE.
Take it.

SOULBADGE.


JANINE: You're so
tough! I have a
special gift!

It's TOXIC, a pow-
erful poison that

steadily saps the

JANINE: I'm going
to really apply

myself and improve
my skills.

I want to become
better than both
Father and you!


Fufufu!

I'm JANINE, the
GYM LEADER!

No, I'm not!
Gotcha, sucker!


I had you fooled...


How will you dis-
tinguish our real
LEADER?


Fooled you!
Hahaha!


Ooh... I lost...
You're not weak...


Well? Wasn't my
disguise perfect?


I'm JANINE!

How did you know I
was real?

Let's battle!


Darn it!
I wanted to win!


You must be
getting tired.


Wahahaha!

You betcha!
I'm JANINE!


My disguise was
right on! Dang!


Hey, you. Was my
disguise cute or
what, huh?


Yo, CHAMP in
making!

Whoops! Take a
good look around

you. The trainers
all look like the
LEADER, JANINE.

Which of them is
the real JANINE?


That was a great
battle, trainer
from JOHTO!





My grandpa is at 
my brother BILL's
on CERULEAN CAPE.


I saw these weird,
slow POKéMON on
CYCLING ROAD.





Hey! You have a
brand new kind of
POKéDEX.

Did PROF.OAK give
that to you?


I got quite a
shock at the GYM.

There were all
these girls who
looked identical.


I'm JANINE! Hocus-
pocus... Poof!


See? I look just
like her now!







My grandpa is the
SAFARI ZONE WAR-
DEN.

At least he was...

He decided to go
on a vacation and

took off overseas
all by himself.

He quit running
SAFARI ZONE just
like that.


Many people were
disappointed that

SAFARI ZONE closed
down, but Grandpa
is so stubborn...


It's a photo of a
grinning old man

who's surrounded
by POKéMON.


It's a photo of a
huge grassy plain

with rare POKéMON
frolicking in it.





You're working on
a POKéDEX? That's

really something.
Don't give up!






They're fresh out
of POKé BALLS!

When will they get
more of them?


POKé BALLS are in
stock! Now I can
catch POKéMON!


When I was walking
in the grass, a

bug POKéMON poi-
soned my POKéMON!

I just kept going,
but then my
POKéMON fainted.

You should keep an
ANTIDOTE with you.






It's great. I can
store any number

of POKéMON, and
it's all free.


That PC is free
for any trainer
to use.


The COMMUNICATION
CENTER upstairs
was just built.

But they're still
finishing it up.


The COMMUNICATION
CENTER upstairs
was just built.

I traded POKéMON
there already!








You're trying to
see how good you

are as a POKéMON
trainer?

You better visit
the POKéMON GYMS

all over JOHTO and
collect BADGES.


When I get older,
I'm going to be a
GYM LEADER!

I make my POKéMON
battle with my

friend's to make
them tougher!







When I was a wee
lad, I was a hot-
shot trainer!

Here's a word of
advice: Catch lots
of POKéMON!

Treat them all
with kindness!








POKéMON gain expe-
rience in battle

and change their
form.


POKéMON change?

I would be shocked
if one did that!







You know, POKéMON
eat BERRIES.

Well, my POKéMON
got healthier by
eating a BERRY.

Here. I'll share
one with you!


Check trees for
BERRIES. They just
drop right off.






Hello, hello! You
must be {14}.

PROF.ELM said that
you would visit.


This is what I
want PROF.ELM to
examine.


{A1} received
MYSTERY EGG.


I know a couple
who run a POKéMON
DAY-CARE service.

They gave me that
EGG.

I was intrigued,
so I sent mail to
PROF.ELM.

For POKéMON evolu-
tion, PROF.ELM is
the authority.


Even PROF.OAK here
recognizes that.


If my assumption
is correct, PROF.
ELM will know it.


You are returning
to PROF.ELM?

Here. Your POKéMON
should have some
rest.


I'm depending on
you!


Life is delight-
ful! Always, new

discoveries to be
made!


OAK: Aha! So
you're {14}!

I'm OAK! A POKéMON
researcher.

I was just visit-
ing my old friend
MR.POKéMON.

I heard you were
running an errand

for PROF.ELM, so I
waited here.

Oh! What's this?
A rare POKéMON!

Let's see...

Hm, I see!

I understand why
PROF.ELM gave you

a POKéMON for this
errand.

To researchers
like PROF.ELM and

I, POKéMON are our
friends.

He saw that you
would treat your

POKéMON with love
and care.

...Ah!

You seem to be
dependable.

How would you like
to help me out?

See? This is the
latest version of
POKéDEX.

It automatically
records data on

POKéMON you've
seen or caught.

It's a hi-tech
encyclopedia!


{A1} received
POKéDEX!


Go meet many kinds
of POKéMON and

complete that
POKéDEX!

But I've stayed
too long.

I have to get to
GOLDENROD for my
usual radio show.

{14}, I'm
counting on you!


Hm? That SCALE!
What's that?
A red GYARADOS?

That's rare! 
I, I want it...

{14}, would you
care to trade it?

I can offer this
EXP.SHARE I got
from PROF.OAK.


That's disappoint-
ing. That happens
to be very rare.


It's packed with
foreign magazines.

Can't even read
their titles...


It's a big com-
puter. Hmm. It's
broken.


A whole pile of
strange coins!

Maybe they're from
another country...






Hi there!
Did you visit
SPROUT TOWER?


I came too far
out. I'd better
phone home!




...Tell me some-
thing.

Is it true that
TEAM ROCKET has
returned?

What? You beat
them? Hah! Quit
lying.

You're not joking?
Then let's see how
good you are.


... Humph! Useless
POKéMON!

Listen, you. You
only won because

my POKéMON were
weak.


I hate the weak.

POKéMON, trainers.
It doesn't matter
who or what.

I'm going to be
strong and wipe
out the weak.

That goes for TEAM
ROCKET too.

They act big and
tough in a group.

But get them
alone, and they're
weak.

I hate them all.

You stay out of my
way. A weakling

like you is only a
distraction.


...Humph! I knew
you were lying.


It's unsafe to go
in there, so I'm
standing guard.

Aren't I a good
Samaritan?


Do you know about
SLOWPOKETAIL? I
heard it's tasty!

Aren't you glad I
told you that?


The SLOWPOKE have
disappeared from
town...

I heard their
TAILS are being
sold somewhere.


The SLOWPOKE have
returned.

Knowing them, they
could've just been

goofing off some-
where.

POKéMON use WHIRL-
POOL to get across
real whirlpools.

And this... This is
a gift from me!


That TM contains
ICY WIND.

It inflicts damage
and lowers speed.

It demonstrates
the harshness of
winter.


When the ice and
snow melt, spring
arrives.

You and your POKé-
MON will be to-

gether for many
years to come.

Cherish your time
together!


I'll freeze your
POKéMON, so you
can't do a thing!


Darn. I couldn't
do a thing.


I think there's a
move a POKéMON

can use while it's
frozen.


This GYM has a
slippery floor.

It's fun, isn't
it?

But hey--we're
not playing games
here!


Do you see how
serious we are?


This GYM is great.
I love boarding
with my POKéMON!


I know PRYCE's
secret.


OK. I'll tell you
PRYCE's secret.


The secret behind
PRYCE's power...

He meditates under
a waterfall daily

to strengthen his
mind and body.


To get to PRYCE,
our GYM LEADER,

you need to think
before you skate.


I wouldn't lose to
you in skiing!


If you don't skate
with precision,

you won't get far
in this GYM.


Check out my
parallel turn!


No! You made me
wipe out!


I shouldn't have
been bragging
about my skiing...


PRYCE is a veteran
who has trained

POKéMON for some
50 years.

He's said to be
good at freezing

opponents with
ice-type moves.

That means you
should melt him

with your burning
ambition!


PRYCE is some-
thing, but you're
something else!

That was a hot
battle that

bridged the gen-
eration gap!






What's this? TEAM
ROCKET has come
back?

I saw some men in
black at LAKE OF
RAGE...


I stop my POKéMON
from evolving too
early.

I make them learn
certain moves be-
fore I let them
evolve.


POKéMON do become
stronger when they

evolve, but they
also learn moves
more slowly.






MT.MORTAR is like
a maze inside.

Be careful. Don't
get lost in there.








...You have strayed
far...

Here I have medi-
tated. Inside me,

a new power has
been awakened.

Let me share my
power with your

POKéMON.
Take this, child.


Do you see it? It
is HIDDEN POWER!

It draws out the
power of POKéMON
for attacking.

Remember this: its
type and power de-
pend on the POKé-
MON using it.


I am meditating...








LAKE OF RAGE is
actually a crater

made by rampaging
GYARADOS.

The crater filled
up with rainwater

and the LAKE was
formed.

That's the story
passed on from my

Grandpa's great-
great-grandpa.

It used to be that
you could catch

lively MAGIKARP
there, but...

I don't understand
what's happening.


The LAKE hasn't
been normal since

those men wearing
black arrived.


LAKE OF RAGE is
back to normal.

The MAGIKARP have
returned.

I may yet realize
my dream of see-
ing the world's
largest MAGIKARP.

Do you have a ROD?
Please help me if
you do.


Ah, you have a
MAGIKARP! Let's

see how big that
baby is.


Wow! This one is
outstanding!

I tip my hat to
you!

Take this as a
memento!


The record is the
important thing.

Think of that as
a bonus!


Wow! This one is
outstanding!

...I wish I could
say that, but I've

seen a bigger one
before.


What? That's not a
MAGIKARP!


Oh... So you didn't
get one good

enough to show me?
Maybe next time.

They say that no

DAISY: Hi! My kid
brother is the GYM

LEADER in VIRIDIAN

But he goes out

it causes problems
for the trainers.


DAISY: Hi! Good
timing. I'm about
to have some tea.

Would you like to
join me?

Oh, your POKéMON

Would you like me
to groom one?


DAISY: Which one
should I groom?


DAISY: OK, I'll
get it looking
nice in no time.

DAISY: There you
go! All done.

See? Doesn't it
look nice?

It's such a cute
POKéMON.


DAISY: I always

join me.


DAISY: You don't
want to have one

groomed? OK, we'll
just have tea.


DAISY: Oh, sorry.
I honestly can't
groom an EGG.




OAK: Ah, {14}!
It's good of you

to come all this
way to KANTO.

What do you think
of the trainers

out here?
Pretty tough, huh?


How is your POKé-
DEX coming?

Let's see...


If you're in the
area, I hope you
come visit again.


OAK: Wow! That's
excellent!

You collected the
BADGES of GYMS in
KANTO. Well done!

I was right in my
assessment of you.

Tell you what,
{14}. I'll make

arrangements so
that you can go to
MT.SILVER.

MT.SILVER is a big
mountain that is

home to many wild
POKéMON.

It's too dangerous
for your average

trainer, so it's
off limits. But

we can make an
exception in your
case, {14}.

Go up to INDIGO
PLATEAU. You can

reach MT.SILVER
from there.


OAK: Hmm? You're
not collecting
KANTO GYM BADGES?

The GYM LEADERS in
KANTO are as tough

as any you battled
in JOHTO.

I recommend that
you challenge
them.


OAK: Ah, you're
collecting KANTO
GYM BADGES.

I imagine that
it's hard, but the

experience is sure
to help you.

Come see me when
you get them all.

I'll have a gift
for you.

Keep trying hard,
{14}!


The PROF's POKéMON
TALK radio program

isn't aired here
in KANTO.

It's a shame--I'd
like to hear it.


Thanks to your

Don't tell anyone,

You're a rookie
trainer, aren't
you? I can tell!

That's OK! Every-
one is a rookie
at some point!

If you'd like, I
can teach you a
few things.


OK, then!
Follow me!


This is a POKéMON
CENTER. They heal

your POKéMON in no
time at all.

You'll be relying
on them a lot, so

you better learn
about them.


This is a POKéMON
MART.

They sell BALLS
for catching wild

POKéMON and other
useful items.


ROUTE 30 is out
this way.

Trainers will be
battling their

prized POKéMON
there.


This is the sea,
as you can see.

Some POKéMON are
found only in
water.


Here...

It's my house!
Thanks for your
company.

Let me give you a
small gift.


{A1}'s POKéGEAR
now has a MAP!


POKéGEAR becomes
more useful as you
add CARDS.

I wish you luck on
your journey!


Oh... It's something
I enjoy doing...

Fine. Come see me
when you like.


...... ...... ......

You got a POKéMON
at the LAB.

What a waste.
A wimp like you.

...... ...... ....

Don't you get what
I'm saying?

Well, I too, have
a good POKéMON.

I'll show you
what I mean!


Humph. Are you
happy you won?


...... ...... ......

My name's ???.

I'm going to be
the world's great-
est POKéMON
trainer.


Humph. That was a
waste of time.


...... ...... ......

My name's ???.

I'm going to be
the world's great-
est POKéMON
trainer.


Did you talk to
the old man by the
POKéMON CENTER?

He'll put a MAP of
JOHTO on your
POKéGEAR.


When you're with
POKéMON, going
anywhere is fun.


MR.POKéMON's house
is still farther
up ahead.


I battled the
trainers on the
road.

My POKéMON lost.
They're a mess! I

must take them to
a POKéMON CENTER.


A POKéMON I caught
had an item.

I think it's
MYSTIC WATER.

I don't need it,
so do you want it?


Back to fishing

POKéMON data off

my radio. I think
I'm good.


I give!


Music on the radio
changes the moods
of wild POKéMON.


I'm gonna show my
girlfriend I'm hot
stuff!


I wish you would
have lost for me...


I was humiliated
in front of my
girlfriend...


My boyfriend's
weak, so I can't
rely on him.


Oh, my! You're so
strong!


I can count on my
POKéMON more than
my boyfriend.


Are you going to
the GYM? Me too!


Oh. I couldn't
win...


The GYM BADGES are
pretty. I collect
them.


What kinds of
BALLS do you use?


Yikes! Not fast
enough!


Some POKéMON flee
right away.

Try catching them
with KURT's FAST
BALL.

Whenever I find a
WHT APRICORN, I
take it to KURT.

He turns it into a
custom BALL.


Behold my graceful
BALL dexterity!


Whew! That was a
jolt!


I was going to
dazzle you with my
prize POKéMON.

But your prowess
electrified me!


I'll go anywhere
if bug POKéMON
appear there.


Huh? I shouldn't
have lost that...


My VENONAT won me
the Bug-Catching

Contest at the
NATIONAL PARK.


Wow... Look at all
those YANMA!

I'm so blown away,
I can't move.


I'm practicing my
fire breathing.


Ow! I scorched the
tip of my nose!


The POKéMON March
on the radio lures
wild POKéMON.


Danger lurks in
the night!


Whoops!


You know, night-
time is fun in its
own ways.

But don't overdo
it, OK?


Your POKéMON look
pretty tough.

You could go any-
where safely.

I love POKéMON!

That's why I
started--and why

I'll keep on col-
lecting POKéMON!


How could you do
this to me?


What else do I
like besides
POKéMON?

MARY on the radio.
I bet she's cute!


Hey! Do you have
any rare POKéMON?


Oh, my poor POKé-
MON! Darlings!


I'd be happy just
to own a single
rare POKéMON.


Would you get
this?

Some {A2} guy
made fun of my
POKéMON!

Darn it! My POKé-
MON's great!


My NIDOKING did
pretty right on!


It's okay for
people to like

different types
of POKéMON.

POKéMON isn't just
about having the
most powerful one.


I'm in a slump.

Maybe it's the
gear I'm using.

Let's battle for a
change of pace!


I lost, but I feel
better anyway.


KURT's LURE BALL
is the best for

catching hooked
POKéMON.

It's much more
effective than a
ULTRA BALL.


I can do so much
with my POKéMON--
it's super-fun!


Losing isn't fun
at all...


What is going on
at LAKE OF RAGE?

We were planning
to camp there.


Are you going to
LAKE OF RAGE too?

Let's play for a 
little while!


I played too much!


I'm having a pic-

TRAINER TIPS

All POKéMON have
pros and cons

depending on their
types.

If their types
differ, a higher-

level POKéMON may
lose in battle.

Learn which types
are strong and

weak against your
POKéMON's type.




Aack! You made me
lose a POLIWAG!

What are you going
to do about it?


Just forget about
it.


That POLIWAG that
got away...
It was huge.

I swear it must've
been 16 feet long!


I fish until I
can't anymore.

I also battle
until I drop.

That's my
relationship
with my POKéMON.


Hmmmm... 
This isn't right.


That's 100 wins
to 101 losses.

I won't battle
again for a while.


Do you know about
the legendary bird
POKéMON?


Whew! You're hot
stuff.


ARTICUNO, ZAPDOS
and MOLTRES are

the three legend-
ary bird POKéMON.

I heard there are
other legendary
birds, though.


Why can't I ever
beat you?

Oh yeah, here you
go. It's that gift

I couldn't give
you last time.


I'm gonna win,
for sure!


Arrgh... That's a
shocking loss...


It's important to
have conviction
on your side.


I'll do anything
to get my hands on
rare POKéMON!


Oooh, your POKéMON
are so appealing.


If a POKéMON has
different colors

from usual, it's
more valuable.

What? You mean
that's not true?


I can tell you're
a good trainer by
looking at you.

I'm good at POKé-
MON, and I can see
that you are too.


Tch! It's a total
loss on my part.


Wow. You have a
lot of BADGES.

No wonder you're
so tough.

I wonder if
ECRUTEAK GYM's

MORTY is still in
training?

He really hammered
me.


You look strong.

Good trainers seek
tough opponents
instinctively.


Nope! This won't
do at all.


We all get better
by experiencing
many battles.

I battled a lot to
become what I am
today--an elite.


ROUTE 44
ICE PATH AHEAD


ROUTE 44

MAHOGANY TOWN -
BLACKTHORN CITY




Be prepared for
anything!

Let me see if your
POKéMON have been
raised properly!


Oh, I lost that!


I'll head back to
BLACKTHORN's ICE

PATH and train
some more.


Yo! You're spunky!
But you know what?

When it comes to
sheer spunkiness,
I'm the man!


My POKéMON weren't
spunky enough!


Boy, do I love
HP UP! Mmmm, yum!

I keep drinking my
POKéMON's!

I can't help it!


My POKéMON are
power packed!


Wahahah! I'm the
big loser!


I'm not much good
at thinking, see?

So, I just plow
ahead with power!


Why do I climb
mountains?

Because they're
there.

Why do I train
POKéMON?

Because they're
there!


Losses...
They're there too!


The best thing to
ever happen to me

was discovering
POKéMON.


I just can't find
a way to win!

Keep it up!

Oh, and take this
--it's the gift

you couldn't take
when we last met.


I was training
here alone.

Behold the fruits
of my labor!


Waaaargh!


This calls for
extreme measures.

I must take to the
hills and train in
solitude.


I'm going to train
a bit more before
I break for lunch.


We had plenty of
rest at lunch, so

now we're all
ready to go again!

We're going to
train again!


What are your
thoughts on rais-
ing POKéMON?


You've won my
respect.


I see you're rais-
ing your POKéMON
with care.

The bond you build
will save you in
tough situations.


What is your
battle strategy?

It is foolish to
use strong moves
indiscriminately.


Fine. I lost.


I'm not in favor
of overly power-
ful moves.

I want to win, but
I also don't want
to harm POKéMON.


I'm really, really
tough!

Is there anywhere
I can prove how
tough I really am?


I'm really, really
tough!


I was tough at the

You took on one

You crossed the
sea to get here?

That must have
been hard.

It would be much

POKéMON knew how
to FLY...


But you can't use
FLY without this
city's GYM BADGE.

If you beat the
GYM LEADER here,
come see me.

I'll have a nice
gift for you.


That's CIANWOOD's

Then you should
take this HM.


Teach FLY to your

You will be able
to FLY instantly

to anywhere you

My husband lost to
you, so he needs

That's good, since
he was getting a
little chubby.


If you use FLY,
you can get back

Boulders to the

SUICUNE is beau-

roads at simply
awesome speeds.

It's wonderful...

I want to see
SUICUNE up close...

I've decided.

I'll battle you as
a trainer to earn
SUICUNE's respect!

Come on, {A1}.
Let's battle now!


I hate to admit
it, but you win.


You're amazing,
{A1}!

No wonder POKéMON
gravitate to you.

I get it now.

I'm going to keep

I'm sure we'll see

Hey!


Do you know what

You've taken your
first step into
KANTO.

Check your POKé-

You look pretty
strong.
Let me battle you!


Yow!


If you prevail on
this harsh trek,

the truth will be
revealed!

Heh, sorry, I just
wanted to say
something cool.


Hm? You're good,
aren't you?


Just as I thought!


A good trainer can
recognize other
good trainers.


You shouldn't
underestimate the

wild POKéMON in
these parts.


Oh! You're much
too strong!


You're just a kid,
but you're not to

be underestimated
either.


It's rare to see
anyone come here.

Are you training
on your own?


Oh! You're really
strong!


I'm checking out
pre- and post-
evolution POKéMON.

Evolution really
does make POKéMON
stronger.

But evolved forms
also learn moves
later on.


Don't say a thing!

Let me guess what
you're thinking.

Mmmmmmm...

I got it! You're
on the POKéMON
LEAGUE challenge!


You're too much!


With your skills,
you'll do well at

POKéMON hide in

I've seen you a
couple times. How

many POKéMON have
you caught?

Would you like me
to show you how to
catch POKéMON?


That's how you do
it.

If you weaken them
first, POKéMON are
easier to catch.


Oh. Fine, then.

Anyway, if you
want to catch

POKéMON, you have
to walk a lot.


Huh? You want me
to show you how to
catch POKéMON?


Yo. How are your
POKéMON?

If they're weak
and not ready for

battle, keep out
of the grass.


See those ledges?
It's scary to jump
off them.

But you can go to
NEW BARK without

walking through
the grass.

It strengthens

Go, RATTATA!

TACKLE!


What? This is a
big battle!
Leave me alone!


I just lost, so
I'm trying to find
more POKéMON.

Wait! You look
weak! Come on,
let's battle!


Ack! I lost again!
Doggone it!


Do I have to have
more POKéMON in

order to battle
better?

No! I'm sticking
with this one no
matter what!


You're a POKéMON
trainer, right?

Then you have to
battle!


That's strange.
I won before.


Becoming a good
trainer is really
tough.

I'm going to bat-
tle other people
to get better.


Instead of a bug
POKéMON, I found
a trainer!


Argh! You're too
strong!


I ran out of POKé
BALLS while I was
catching POKéMON.

I should've bought
some more...


MR.POKéMON's
house? It's a bit
farther ahead.


Everyone's having
fun battling!
You should too!


I'm not a trainer.

But if you look
one in the eyes,
prepare to battle.

No stealing other

POKé BALLS are to
be thrown only at
wild POKéMON!


I lost again...
Gee, you're tough!

Oh yeah, I almost
forgot that I had
to give you this.

Use it to get even
tougher, OK?

I'm going to get
tougher too.




Fly high into the
sky, my beloved
bird POKéMON!


I feel like just
flying away now.


I plan to train in
CIANWOOD CITY to

teach my POKéMON
how to FLY.


Let me try some-
thing I learned
today.


I didn't study
enough, I guess.


I have to take so
many tests, I

don't have much
time for POKéMON.

So when I do get
to play, I really
concentrate.


You seem to be
good at POKéMON.

If you are, how
about giving me
some advice?


I see. So you can
battle that way.


I know something
good!

MOOMOO FARM's milk
is famous for its
flavor.


Hi! Aren't you a
cute trainer!

May I see your
POKéMON?


I'm glad I got to
see your POKéMON!


When I see POKé-
MON, it seems to
soothe my nerves.


I've been over-
seas, so I know

about all sorts of
POKéMON!


Your skill is
world class!


All kinds of peo-
ple around the

world live happily
with POKéMON.


Don't you think my
POKéMON and I are
beautiful?


We drink MOOMOO
MILK every day.


MOOMOO MILK is
good for beauty

and health, but
inconveniently,

they only sell a

TRAINER TIPS

If a POKéMON is
trying to evolve,
you can stop it.

Press the B But-
ton during evolu-
tion.

That startles the
POKéMON and stops
its evolution.




Bow down before my
regal POKéMON!


How... How dare you
mock royalty!


Doesn't everyone
wish to someday be
a king?


Nihihi! Would you
like to battle my
PIKACHU gang?


PI-PIKACHU!


You look like you
have many POKéMON,

but PIKACHU is
still the best.


Agility is the key
attribute of bird
POKéMON.


You beat me with
your speed...


Your POKéMON are
remarkably well-
trained.


Check out my POKé-
MON. Just look at

their coloring and
their plumage.


Shoot!
Not good enough!


If you groom them,
POKéMON get happy.


I should go to
ROCK TUNNEL to get
myself an ONIX.


I lost...

tures don't appear

BROCK: Wow, it's
not often that we

get a challenger
from JOHTO.

I'm BROCK, the
PEWTER GYM LEADER.

I'm an expert on
rock-type POKéMON.

My POKéMON are im-
pervious to most

physical attacks.
You'll have a hard

time inflicting
any damage.

Come on!


BROCK: Your POKé-
MON's powerful at-
tacks overcame my
rock-hard defense...

You're stronger
than I expected...

Go ahead--take
this BADGE.


{A1} received
BOULDERBADGE.


BROCK: {14},
thanks. I enjoyed

battling you, even
though I am a bit
upset.

That BOULDERBADGE
will make your

POKéMON even more
powerful.


BROCK: The world
is huge. There are

still many strong
trainers like you.

Just wait and see.
I'm going to be-
come a lot strong-
er too.


The trainers of
this GYM use rock-
type POKéMON.

The rock-type has
high DEFENSE.

Battles could end
up going a long

time. Are you
ready for this?


I have to win
these battles...


Hey, you! Trainer
from JOHTO! BROCK

is tough. He'll
punish you if you

don't take him
seriously.


Yo! CHAMP in
making! You're

really rocking.
Are you battling

the GYM LEADERS of
KANTO?

They're strong and
dedicated people,

just like JOHTO's
GYM LEADERS.


Yo! CHAMP in
making! That GYM

didn't give you
much trouble.

The way you took
charge was really

inspiring. I mean
that seriously.




Hi! Check out my
GYARADOS!

I raised it from a
MAGIKARP. I can't

believe how strong
it has become.


There once was a
weird old man who
sold MAGIKARP.

He was saying the
MAGIKARP from the

LAKE OF RAGE were
excellent.




...Yeah, and the
GYM in CINNABAR's

gone. I was really
amazed.

...Yes? I'm on the
phone. Go away!


JIGGLYPUFF: Puu
pupuu.


Most POKéMON get
drowsy if they

hear a JIGGLYPUFF
singing.

There are several
moves that can be

used only while a
POKéMON is asleep.




I like snoozing
with the radio on...
...Zzzz...




Oh, no. Oh, no...

My daughter is
missing.

No... She couldn't
have gone to the
BURNED TOWER.

I told her not to
go near it...

People seem to
disappear there...

Oh, what should I
do...?


ECRUTEAK used to
have two towers:

one each in the
east and west.


Ah, child.
Have you learned

to dance like the
KIMONO GIRLS?

If you go to their
DANCE THEATER, an

odd old man will
give you something
nice, I hear.


I'm going to prac-
tice at the DANCE

THEATER. Care to
join me?


The tower that
used to be here...

My grandma told me
it used to be much
taller.


Three big POKéMON
ran off in differ-
ent directions.
What were they?


I heard a rumor
about OLIVINE
LIGHTHOUSE.

The POKéMON that
serves as the

beacon fell ill.
Sounds like they
are in trouble.


The POKéMON at
OLIVINE LIGHTHOUSE
has been cured.

Boats can safely
sail out to sea at
night again.


I hear POKéMON are
rampaging at the

LAKE OF RAGE. I'd
like to see that.


In the distant
past...

This tower burned
in a fire. Three

nameless POKéMON
perished in it.

A rainbow-colored
POKéMON descended

from the sky and
resurrected them...

It's a legend that
has been passed

down by ECRUTEAK
GYM LEADERS.

Me?

I was a trainer
way back when.
Hohoho!

I'm making my
final preparations

for the POKéMON
LEAGUE.


I blew it!


It's going to be
tough to win at
the LEAGUE.

I need to do some
more training.

I hear that the
LEAGUE's ELITE

FOUR are tougher
than GYM LEADERS.


By experiencing
tough battles, you
gain power.


Gaah! Life is even
tougher!


To get to POKéMON
LEAGUE, you have

to get through
VICTORY ROAD.

But VICTORY ROAD
is tough.

Practically nobody
goes there!


Since you've come
this far, you must
be good.

I'm going to give
this battle every-
thing I've got!


No! I don't
believe this!


I've defeated
eight GYM LEADERS,

so I was feeling
confident.

I'll have to try
harder next time.


I lost to a train-
er named {A2}.

He was really
strong, but...

It was as if he
absolutely had to
win at any cost.

I felt sorry for
his POKéMON.


POKéMON aren't
tools of war.


POKéMON are in-
valuable, lifelong
partners.


Wow, look at all
those BADGES!
I'm impressed.

But you're not
satisfied by just

collecting them,
right?


Good battle!


People and POKéMON
grow from their
experiences.

Don't get lazy and
complacent.


I'm feeling great
today!

I feel like I
could boot even
the LEAGUE CHAMP!


No! Not in this
battle!


Just like in fish-
ing, it's all over

in POKéMON if you
give up.

DARK CAVE...

If POKéMON could
light it up, I'd

I caught a bunch
of POKéMON. Let me
battle with you!


Awwwww...


You can catch
POKéMON even if

you have six with
you.

If you catch one,
it'll go to your
BOX automatically.


... Hnuurg... Huh?

I walked too far
today looking for
POKéMON.

My feet hurt and
I'm sleepy...

If I were a wild
POKéMON, I'd be
easy to catch...

...Zzzz...


...Zzzz... Huh?

What's that? You
have MAIL for me?


{A1} handed
over the POKéMON
holding the MAIL.


Let's see...

...DARK CAVE leads
to another road...

That's good to
know.

Thanks for bring-
ing this to me.

My friend's a good
guy, and you're
swell too!

I'd like to do
something good in
return too!

I know! I want you
to have this!


TM50 is NIGHTMARE.

It's a wicked move
that steadily cuts

the HP of a sleep-
ing enemy.

Ooooh...
That's scary...

I don't want to
have bad dreams.


This MAIL isn't
for me.


Why is this POKé-
MON so special?

It doesn't have
any MAIL.


What? You don't
want anything?


If I take that
POKéMON from you,

what are you going
to use in battle?


I found a good
POKéMON in DARK
CAVE.

I'm going to raise
it to take on
FALKNER.

So how about a
POKéMON battle?


Awaaargh!


My POKéMON were
caught and raised
overseas.

They're my compan-
ions on those long
voyages.


This is a good
time to brag about
my PIKACHU!


I had no time to
show off PIKACHU...


I'm not listening
to your bragging!

We POKé FANS have
a policy of not

listening to other
people brag!


Such darling
POKéMON.

Let's show our
POKéMON together
at the same time.


I don't mind
losing.


Do you know about
baby POKéMON?

I bet they're just
adorable!


PIKACHU is it!
Don't you agree?


Let me see what
your POKéMON are
capable of.


Ooh, your POKéMON
have potential.


You know how POKé-
MON have different
abilities?

People are like
that too. Every-
one has different
potential.


Ufufufu... I hope it
gets dark soon.


You came at just
the right time.

Let's battle.


Oh, how disap-
pointing...


I met my MEOWTH at
night, right here
on ROUTE 39.

I'm not sure why,
but it seems to

like it when I
train here.

It seems to become

training here than
anywhere else.

TRAINER TIPS

Use HEADBUTT on
trees to shake
POKéMON out.

Different kinds of
POKéMON drop out
of trees.

Use HEADBUTT on
any tree you see!




You have to warm
up before going
into the water.

That's basic.


OK! Uncle! I give!


CIANWOOD CITY is
a good distance
away from here.


Hey, you're young
and fit!

Don't ride your
POKéMON! Swim!


Uh-oh. I lost...


Swimming exercises
your entire body.
It's healthy.


Are you going to
CIANWOOD?

How about a quick
battle first?


I lost that one!


I'd say I'm a bet-
ter swimmer than
you. Yeah!


No inner tube for
me.

I'm hanging on to
a sea POKéMON!


Ooh, I'm feeling
dizzy!


While I float like
this, the waves
carry me along.


Although you can't
see it from here,

CIANWOOD is across
the sea.


Hm! There's a big
building up ahead!

What is it?


Hm! Look at all
those serious-
looking trainers
streaming in.

What? What?


I came to OLIVINE
by ship to see the

sights and soak up
the atmosphere.

Being a port, it
feels so different
from a big city.


Have you gone to
the BATTLE TOWER?

I think a lot of
tough trainers

have gathered
there already.

But since you have
so many BADGES,

you shouldn't do
badly at all.


MONICA: Glad to
meet you. I'm

MONICA of Monday.


As a token of our
friendship, I have
a gift for you!


MONICA: It's an
item that raises

the power of fly-
ing-type moves.

You should equip a
bird POKéMON with
that item.


MONICA: My broth-
ers and sisters

are all over the
place.

See if you could
find them all!


MONICA: I don't
think today is
Monday. How sad...

Isn't it relaxing
just floating like
this?


I'm a bit tired.
If I win, lend me
your POKéMON.


Pant, pant...


It's so far to
CIANWOOD.

But it's no easy
return trip to
OLIVINE either.

What should I do?


See those islands
that are blocked
by whirlpools?

There just has to
be a secret!


What's the secret
to your strength?


It was a dark and
stormy night...

I saw this giant
POKéMON flying
from the islands.

It was scattering
feathers from its
silver wings.


The waves are wild
here.

They tire you out
while you swim.


I'm beat!


The currents keep
me from reaching
that island.


Are you seeking
the secrets of
WHIRL ISLANDS?


Ooh, you've got
great endurance!


A secret about
WHIRL ISLANDS...

It's pitch-black
inside!


I'm on my way to
WHIRL ISLANDS.

I'm going explor-
ing with friends.


Is that how you do
it?


There's supposed
to be a big POKé-
MON deep beneath
WHIRL ISLANDS.

I wonder what it
could be?


You look so ele-
gant, riding your
POKéMON.


I'm crushed...


Wasn't there a hit
song about a boy
riding a LAPRAS?


The weather is so
beautiful, I'm in
a daze!


Ohhh!


A sunburn is the
worst for skin.

But I don't use a
sunblock.

I won't pollute
the water.


If you need to
rest, just tread
water.

You'll get your
wind back, so you

can keep on going
strong.


Oh! You have more
energy than I do.


I heard roars from
deep inside the
ISLANDS.


At night, STARYU
gather near the
water's surface.


Oh, dear...


The clusters of
STARYU light up
at the same time.

It's so beautiful,
it's scary.




Patience is the
key to both fish-
ing and POKéMON.


Gwaaah!


I'm too impatient
for fishing...


I feel so content,
fishing while lis-
tening to some
tunes on my radio.


My stupid radio
distracted me!


Have you checked
out KANTO's radio

programs? We get a
good variety here.


What's most impor-
tant in our every-
day lives?


The answer is
coming up next!


I think electric-
ity is the most

important thing in
our daily lives.

If it weren't,
people wouldn't

have made such a
fuss when the

POWER PLANT went
out of commission.

are like that.


I'm raising POKé-
MON too!

Will you battle
with me?


Wha...?


I did my best but
came up short.

No excuses--I
admit I lost.


I raise POKéMON
too!

Will you battle
with me?


Oh, rats!


I've been to many
GYMS, but the GYM

in GOLDENROD is my
favorite.

It's filled with
pretty flowers!


Aww... I keep losing
all the time!

I'll just have to
try harder!

Anyway, thanks for
battling me again

and again. Here's
that present from
the other time.


ROUTE 46
MOUNTAIN RD. AHEAD




Hey, kid! I just
had a double shot

of espresso, and
I am wired!

I need to talk to
someone, so you'll
have to do!

I might not look
like much now, but

I was an expert at
catching POKéMON.

Do you believe me?


Good, good. Yes, I
was something out

of the ordinary,
let me tell you!


What? You little
whelp!

If I were just a
bit younger, I'd

show you a thing
or two. Humph!


This GYM didn't
have a LEADER
until recently.

A young man from
PALLET became the

LEADER, but he's
often away.


Are you going to
battle the LEADER?

Good luck to you.
You'll need it.


Yawn!

I must have dozed
off in the sun.

...I had this dream
about a DROWZEE

eating my dream.
Weird, huh?

Huh?
What's this?

Where did this TM
come from?

This is spooky!
Here, you can have
this TM.


TM42 contains

Have you forgotten
anything?


Kyaaah!


Before I became a
teacher, I used to

forget a lot of
things.


On sunny days, I
think that the

kids would rather
be playing in the

schoolyard than
studying in class.


I didn't want to
lose...


Studying is impor-
tant, but exercise
is just as vital.


Hang on. I have to
phone my mom.


Sorry, Mom!
I was beaten!


My mom worries so
much about me, I

have to phone her
all the time.


Let's battle.
I won't lose!


I forgot to do my
homework!


Sayonara! I just
learned that in my
Japanese class.


We're on a field
trip to LAVENDER

RADIO TOWER for
social studies.


You're wickedly
tough!


I'm tired of walk-
ing. I need to
take a break.


My favorite class
is gym!


Oh, no!
How could I lose?


If POKéMON were a
subject at school,
I'd be the best!


ROUTE 15

FUCHSIA CITY -

VERMILION PORT is
KANTO's seaside
gateway.

Luxury liners from
around the world
dock here.


My POKéMON is
preparing the land
for construction.

But I have no
money to start the
project...


MACHOP: Guooh
gogogoh!


A MACHOP is growl-
ing while stomping
the ground flat.


There are eight
GYMS in KANTO.

That big building
is VERMILION's
POKéMON GYM.


SNORLAX is snoring
peacefully...


The POKéGEAR was
placed near the
sleeping SNORLAX...

...

SNORLAX woke up!


Skilled trainers
gather in KANTO.

GYM LEADERS are
especially strong.

They won't be easy
to defeat.


You've started to
collect KANTO GYM
BADGES?

Don't you agree
that the trainers
here are tough?


I guess you'll be
finished with your

conquest of KANTO
GYMS soon.

Let me know if
you get all eight
BADGES.


Congratulations!

You got all the
KANTO GYM BADGES.

I've got a reward
for your efforts.


Having a variety
of POKéMON types

should give you an
edge in battle.

I'm sure the KANTO
GYM BADGES will
help you.

I came to explore
ROCK TUNNEL.


Whoa! Danger, man.


My POKéMON were
hurt before even

entering ROCK
TUNNEL.

I'd better take
them to a POKéMON
CENTER right away.


Have you ever been
to a picnic?

They're so much
fun!


Ohhhh!


We bake lots of
goodies and share

them all around.
They're delicious!


Hey, you!
Don't litter!


I was just point-
ing out...


Sorry. You weren't
littering. It was
my mistake.


People shouldn't
leave any litter
behind.


Ohh... I lost...


Conserving energy

the environment is

I'll tell you a

But first, we
battle!


Oh, dang!
I lost that...


The POWER PLANT is

river.


ROUTE 9

CERULEAN CITY -
ROCK TUNNEL




CINNABAR GYM's
BLAINE apparently

lives alone in the
SEAFOAM ISLANDS
cave...


It's been a year
since the volcano
erupted.




CINNABAR's volcano
erupted.

It hurled boulders
that cut off ROUTE
19 indefinitely.

I wonder if the
people of CINNABAR
are safe...


No CINNABAR citi-
zens were injured

by the eruption.
That's great!




BLAINE: Waaah!

My GYM in CINNABAR
burned down.

My fire-breathing
POKéMON and I are

homeless because
of the volcano.

Waaah!

But I'm back in
business as a GYM

LEADER here in
this cave.

If you can beat
me, I'll give you
a BADGE.

Ha! You'd better
have BURN HEAL!


BLAINE: Awesome.
I've burned out...

You've earned
VOLCANOBADGE!


{A1} received
VOLCANOBADGE.


BLAINE: I did lose
this time, but I'm

going to win the
next time.

When I rebuild my
CINNABAR GYM,

we'll have to have
a rematch.


BLAINE: My fire
POKéMON will be

even stronger.
Just you watch!


Yo!

... Huh? It's over
already?

Sorry, sorry!

CINNABAR GYM was
gone, so I didn't

know where to find
you.

But, hey, you're
plenty strong even

without my advice.
I knew you'd win!


A POKéMON GYM can
be anywhere as

long as the GYM
LEADER is there.

There's no need
for a building.




I came through the
tunnel, but I

still have plenty
of energy left.


Whoa! You've got
more zip than me!


We HIKERS are at
our best in the
mountains.


Hey, did you get a
DUNSPARCE?

I caught one too.

Take a look at it
in the light. It's
got a funny face!


Pant, pant...

I finally got
through that cave.

It was much bigger
than I'd expected.

I got too tired to
explore the whole

thing, so I came
outside.


ROUTE 33




My bug POKéMON are
tough. Prepare to
lose!


I was whipped...


I'm going to look
for stronger bug
POKéMON.


If you walk in
tall grass wearing

shorts, do you get
nicks and cuts?


Ouch, ouch, ouch!


They'll really
sting when you
take a bath.


Why don't girls
like bug POKéMON?


No good!


Bug POKéMON squish
like plush toys

when you squeeze
their bellies.

I love how they
feel!

Awww... I've got a

For trainers, it's

battle whenever we
meet.


You there!
Want to battle?


Down and out...


You're strong.

You obviously must
have trained hard.

If I win, you have
to help me with my
suntan lotion!


I'm worried about
sunburn...


I have to watch
out for blemishes
caused by the sun.


I'm bored by fish-
ing. Let's battle!


Utter failure...


I'll just go back
to fishing...




Who are you?

Well, it's plain
to see that you're
a trainer...

My name's BLUE.

I was once the
CHAMPION, although

it was for only a
short time...

That meddling RED
did me in...

Anyway, what do
you want? You want

to challenge me or
something?

...I hate to say
it, but I'm not in

the mood for a
battle now.

Take a good look
around you...

A volcano erupts,
and just like

that, a whole town
disappears.

We can go on win-
ning and losing in

POKéMON. But if
nature so much as

twitches, we can
lose in a second.

...

That's the way it
is...

But, anyway, I'm
still a trainer.

If I see a strong
opponent, it makes
me want to battle.

If you want to
battle me, come to
the VIRIDIAN GYM.

I'll take you on
then.


There's a notice
here...

CINNABAR GYM has
relocated to SEA-
FOAM ISLANDS.

I feel so much
lighter in water.


Oh, no!


Swimming exercises
your full body.

It's really good
for you.


What an impressive
collection of GYM

BADGES. We should
battle!


No!


SURF is no longer
the only HM move
you use in water.


I guess it's im-
possible to swim

all the way to
JOHTO.


Aiyah!


Besides the sea, I
can also swim in
ponds and rivers.


What does this
sign say?

CINNABAR GYM

If you're looking
for POKéMON, you

have to look in

Ayieee!


Since you're so
strong, it must be

Whoa, you kick!


Don't get cocky,

Wow. That's a cool
BICYCLE!


But you don't just
look cool...


I look cool, but
I'm weak, so I'm
not really cool.

I have to train
harder...


Hey! Want to have
a speed battle?


Yikes! You've got
awesome torque!


Hands-free riding

Let me tell you,
I had a hard time

catching my prized
POKéMON.


Awaaah!


SQUIRTLE, CHARMAN-
DER and BULBASAUR...

I think that's a
well-balanced mix.


My dream is to fly
with my beloved
bird POKéMON.


I can dream, but I
can't ever fly...


You have POKéMON
that know the HM

move FLY, don't
you? I envy you.


Hi. Did you know...?

POKéMON get more
friendly if you

train them in a
place that they
remember.


Where did I meet
this PSYDUCK?


If only there were
an easy way to

identify where I
got my POKéMON...




That's quite some
building, eh?

It's KANTO's RADIO
TOWER.


KANTO has many
good radio shows.


People come from
all over to pay

their respects to
the departed souls
of POKéMON.


You need a POKé

You looked strong.

I was afraid to
take you on...


I can run like the

Step right up and

raise, put it out

first, then switch
it right away.

That's how to do
it.


I have a feeling
that I can win.

Let's see if I'm
right!


Aww, you are too

number? I'll call.


I'll call you as
soon as I get
something pretty.


You sure? Well,
tell me if you
change your mind.


Huh? Your phone
list is full.


Tweet! Tweeeet!

Kept me waiting!
Go, FARFETCH'D!


Kept me waiting!
Look, this is it!

See? Isn't it some
kind of pretty?


Huh? You don't
have anywhere to

put this. Better
come back for it.


Not bad...
It's something to

beat me, even by
an unlikely fluke...

I like you! Give
me your number!

You can be my
practice partner!


Give me your phone
number!

You are going to
be my practice
partner!


Don't be too proud
about beating me!

It was a fluke!


I don't believe
it! You're going
to regret this!


What? Your phone
list has no room!


What took you?
Start right away!


Listen, can I get
your phone number?

I'll ring you for
some battles.

I'm a rookie too, 
so I think it'd be
a good motivator.


Can I get your
phone number?

I don't want to
lose against you!

We have to battle
again, OK?


I'll ring you
whenever I get the
urge to battle!


Oh, all right...

But I won't lose
to you again!


Huh, what? Your
phone's full.


I've been waiting!
Let's battle now!


Hey, wait! Your
PACK is stuffed!

Well, we'll leave
it till next time.


And yet another
loss...

No doubt about
it--you're tough.

Being beaten this
often actually
feels good now!

Here, take this. 
Use it to get even

tougher. That will
toughen me up too!


You're awesome!
I like you!

I look for POKéMON
here every day.

When I'm in the
grass, I find all
kinds of BERRIES.

If you'd like,
I'll share some.

Could I get your
phone number?


When I'm in the

Could I get your
phone number?


You'll hear from
me as soon as I

find anything that
you might like.


Oh well. Don't be
shy if you want to
get my number.


Your phone list
has no room for my
number.


I was waiting for
you. Let's battle!


Good to see you!
See? This is what

I found.
It's for you!


Oops, your PACK's
full. Too bad.

You should come
back for it later.


Don't young people
fish anymore?

I've seen rare
POKéMON while I've
been fishing...

You young people
like that, right?

Want to trade
phone numbers?

I'll let you know
if I see anything.


Hm? So you do want
me to phone if I
see rare POKéMON?


Yep, phone if I
see rare POKéMON.

Don't worry, I
won't forget!


Oh...
My own kids won't

even give me their
phone numbers...

Is that how young
people are today?


Your phone's
memory is full.

It seems that
young people all
have POKéGEAR.


Hey, kid!

No losing for me
this day!


Oh? You're on a
big journey to see
the sights? Neat!

Let's be friends!
Can I have your
phone number?

I want to hear
about everything
you've seen!


Let's be friends!
Can I have your
phone number?

I want to hear
about everything
you've seen!


I'll telephone you

interesting.


Aww... You won't be

Wait! Your phone
list is filled up!


You're late! Let's
get started now!

Hello?

Oh, hi, {A1}!
Working hard?


Oh, so you're in
...

Isn't that where

is? Did you go
take a look?


Really, you're in
?

I've never gone
there. That's kind
of neat, {A1}.


What? You're in
?

Come see your MOM
sometime!


You're visiting
?

How about coming
home for a bit?


Wow, you're in
?

Good luck on your
POKéMON quest!


That sounds really
tough.

But, {A1}, I
know you're really

determined. You'll
be OK, right?


By the way, you've
saved up ¥.

Do you want to
keep on saving?


It's important to
save your money.


Oh, {A1},
you're not saving

any money. Would
you like to save?


By the way, you've
saved up ¥.

Want to start
saving again?


OK. I'll save your
money.


OK. I won't save
your money.


{A1}, keep it
up! I'm rooting
for you, baby!


Hello?

Oh, hi, {A1}!
Wasn't PROF.ELM
waiting for you?


Hello?

Oh, hi, {A1}!
You're on a big

mission for PROF.
ELM? Be good!


Hello?

Hi, {A1}! If
you're done with

your errand come
on home, dear.


Hello?

...... {A1}?
I heard from PROF.

ELM that you went
on a long trip.

I wish you would
have told me...

What about money?
Should I save it?


Good morning!

This is the POKé-
MON STORAGE SYSTEM

ADMINISTRATION
SERVICE.


Good day!

This is the POKé-
MON STORAGE SYSTEM

ADMINISTRATION
SERVICE.


Good evening!

This is the POKé-
MON STORAGE SYSTEM

ADMINISTRATION
SERVICE.


Who's calling?

{14}, is it?
Hang on a sec...

......
......


Thanks for
waiting!

{14}, your BOX
has room for 
more POKéMON.

Get out there and
fill it up!


Thanks for
waiting!

{14}, your BOX
has room for only
 more POKéMON.

Maybe you should
switch your BOX.


Thanks for
waiting!

{14}, your BOX
is full!

You'll have to
switch BOXES if

you want to catch
more POKéMON.


Hi, {14}?
It's me, BILL!

Thanks for using
my STORAGE SYSTEM.

That last POKéMON
you sent filled
your BOX up.

You'll have to
switch BOXES if

you want to catch
more POKéMON.

Bye now!


Hello, {14}?

Try not to overdo
it.

Be sure to heal
your POKéMON if
they are hurt.


Hello, {14}?

Did you meet MR.
POKéMON? Great!
Come back safely!


{14}? I'm very
upset now.

We had a POKéMON
stolen from here.

How could anyone
do that?


Hello, {14}?

We're checking the
EGG now. It does

appear to be a
POKéMON EGG.


Hello, {14}?

Did you see my
assistant? He's at

the POKéMON CENTER
in VIOLET CITY.


Hello, {14}?

How's the EGG? Has
anything changed?

If anything hap-
pens, please call.


Hello, {14}?
How is the EGG?

What? It hatched?
Wow! What kind of
POKéMON is it?

Please come show
me now!


Hello, {14}?

I just made a new
discovery.

The time it takes
for an EGG to

hatch depends on
the POKéMON.


Hello, {14}?

It's still a
mystery what kinds

of moves hatched
POKéMON have.

We're investigat-
ing that now.


Hello, {14}?

I discovered an
odd thing.

Apparently there's
something called

POKéRUS that in-
fects POKéMON.

Yes, it's like a
virus, so it's
called POKéRUS.

It multiplies fast
and infects other

POKéMON too. But
that's all.

It doesn't seem to
do anything, and

it goes away over
time.

I guess it's
nothing to worry
about. Bye!


H-hello? {14}?
It's a disaster!

Uh, um, it's just
terrible!

What should I do?
It... Oh, no...

Please get back
here now!


Hello, {14}? We
discovered some-

thing about the
EGG!

My assistant is at
the POKéMON CENTER

in VIOLET CITY. 
Could you talk to
him?


{14}, how are
things going?

I called because
something weird is

happening with the
radio broadcasts.

They were talking
about TEAM ROCKET.

{14}, do you
know anything
about it?

Maybe TEAM ROCKET
has returned. No,

that just can't
be true.

Sorry to bug you.
Take care!


Hello, {14}?

I have something
here for you.

Could you swing by
my LAB?

See you later!


Hello, {14}?
How's it going?

I got ahold of
something neat.

Swing by my LAB
and pick it up!

See you later!


Hello. This is

feelers to stab
anything it
touches.


JELLYFISH

When its 80 feel-
ers absorb water,
it stretches to

become like a net
to entangle its
prey.


ROCK

Proud of their
sturdy bodies,
they bash against

each other in a
contest to prove
whose is harder.


ROCK

It travels by rol-
ling on mountain
paths. If it gains

too much speed, it
stops by running
into huge rocks.


MEGATON

Its rock-like body
is so durable,
even high-powered

dynamite blasts
fail to scratch
its rugged hide.


FIRE HORSE

Training by
jumping over grass
that grows longer

every day has made
it a world-class
jumper.


FIRE HORSE

It just loves to
gallop. The faster
it goes, the long-

er the swaying
flames of its mane
will become.


DOPEY

It is always so
absent-minded that
it won't react,

even if its
flavorful tail is
bitten.


HERMITCRAB

An attached
SHELLDER won't let
go because of the

tasty flavor that
oozes out of its
tail.


MAGNET

The electricity
emitted by the
units on each side

of its body cause
it to become a
strong magnet.


MAGNET

When many
MAGNETON gather
together, the

resulting magnetic
storm disrupts
radio waves.


WILD DUCK

In order to pre-
vent their
extinction, more

people have made
an effort to breed
these POKéMON.


TWIN BIRD

It lives on a
grassy plain where
it can see a long

way. If it sees an
enemy, it runs
away at 60 mph.


TRIPLEBIRD

An enemy that
takes its eyes off
any of the three

heads--even for a
second--will get
pecked severely.


SEA LION

The light blue fur
that covers it
keeps it protected

against the cold.
It loves iceberg-
filled oceans.


SEA LION

It sleeps under
shallow ocean
waters during the

day, then looks
for food at night
when it's cold.


SLUDGE

When two of these
POKéMON's bodies
are combined

together, new
poisons are
created.


SLUDGE

As it moves, a
very strong poison
leaks from it,

making the ground
there barren for
three years.


BIVALVE

Clamping on to an
opponent reveals
its vulnerable

parts, so it uses
this move only as
a last resort.


BIVALVE

Even a missile
can't break the
spikes it uses to

stab opponents.
They're even hard-
er than its shell.


GAS

It wraps its op-
ponent in its gas-
like body, slowly

weakening its prey
by poisoning it
through the skin.


GAS

It hides in the
dark, planning to
take the life of

the next living
thing that wanders
close by.


SHADOW

Hiding in people's
shadows at night,
it absorbs their

heat. The chill it
causes makes the
victims shake.


ROCK SNAKE

As it digs through
the ground, it
absorbs many hard

objects. This is
what makes its
body so solid.


HYPNOSIS

When it twitches
its nose, it can
tell where someone

is sleeping and
what that person
is dreaming about.


HYPNOSIS

The longer it
swings its
pendulum, the

longer the effects
of its hypnosis
last.


RIVER CRAB

If it is unable
to find food, it
will absorb

nutrients by
swallowing a
mouthful of sand.


PINCER

Its oversized claw
is very powerful,
but when it's not

in battle, the
claw just gets in
the way.


BALL

During the study
of this POKéMON,
it was discovered

that its compo-
nents are not
found in nature.


BALL

The more energy it
charges up, the
faster it gets.

But this also
makes it more
likely to explode.


EGG

If even one is
separated from the
group, the energy

bond between the
six will make them
rejoin instantly.


COCONUT

Living in a good
environment makes
it grow lots of

heads. A head that
drops off becomes
an EXEGGCUTE.


LONELY

It lost its mother
after its birth.
It wears its

mother's skull,
never revealing
its true face.


BONEKEEPER

Somewhere in the
world is a ceme-
tery just for

MAROWAK. It gets
its bones from
those graves.


KICKING

It is also called
the Kick Master.
It uses its

elastic legs to
execute every
known kick.


PUNCHING

To increase the
strength of all
its punch moves,

it spins its arms
just before making
contact.


LICKING

It has a tongue
that is over 6'6''
long. It uses this

long tongue to
lick its body
clean.


POISON GAS

If one gets close
enough to it when
it expels poison-

ous gas, the gas
swirling inside it
can be seen.


POISON GAS

When it inhales
poisonous gases
from garbage, its

body expands, and
its insides smell
much worse.


SPIKES

It can remember
only one thing at
a time. Once it

starts rushing, it
forgets why it
started.


DRILL

By lightly spin-
ning its drill-
like horn, it can

easily shatter
even a diamond in
the rough.


EGG

People try to
catch it for its
extremely

nutritious eggs,
but it rarely can
be found.


VINE

During battle, it
constantly moves
the vines that

cover its body in
order to annoy its
opponent.


PARENT

To avoid
crushing the
baby it carries in

its pouch, it
always sleeps
standing up.


DRAGON

When they're in a
safe location,
they can be seen

playfully tangling
their tails
together.


DRAGON

The male raises
the young. If it
is approached, it

uses its toxic
spikes to fend off
the intruder.


GOLDFISH

During spawning
season, they swim
gracefully in the

water, searching
for their perfect
mate.


GOLDFISH

When autumn comes,
the males patrol
the area around

their nests in
order to protect
their offspring.


STARSHAPE

When the stars
twinkle at night,
it floats up from

the sea floor, and
its body's center
core flickers.


MYSTERIOUS

It is said that it
uses the seven-
colored core of

its body to send
electric waves
into outer space.


BARRIER

It uses the
mysterious
power it has in

its fingers to
solidify air into
an invisible wall.


MANTIS

It's very proud of
its speed. It
moves so fast that

its opponent does
not even know what
knocked it down.


HUMANSHAPE

It has several
different cry pat-
terns, each of

which seems to
have its own
meaning.


ELECTRIC

When two
ELECTABUZZ touch,
they control the

electric currents
to communicate
their feelings.


SPITFIRE

It moves more
frequently in hot
areas. It can heal

itself by dipping
its wound into
lava.


STAGBEETLE

When the tempera-
ture drops at
night, it sleeps

on treetops or
among roots where
it is well hidden.


WILD BULL

These violent
POKéMON fight
with other mem-

bers of their herd
in order to prove
their strength.






It's a fruit-

Your POKéDEX is

To evolve, some
POKéMON grow,

others use the

POKéMON, not just

Hello! Sorry to
keep you waiting!

Welcome to the
world of POKéMON!

My name is OAK.

People call me the
POKéMON PROF.


This world is in-
habited by crea-
tures that we call
POKéMON.


People and POKéMON
live together by

supporting each
other.

Some people play
with POKéMON, some
battle with them.


But we don't know
everything about
POKéMON yet.

There are still
many mysteries to
solve.

That's why I study
POKéMON every day.


Now, what did you
say your name was?


{A1}, are you
ready?

Your very own
POKéMON story is
about to unfold.

You'll face fun
times and tough
challenges.

A world of dreams
and adventures

with POKéMON
awaits! Let's go!

I'll be seeing you
later!

Is that OK?

mobile battles?


For a mobile
battle, choose

The maximum daily
play time is ten

minutes for each
linked player.

If a battle isn't
finished within

the time limit,
the player with

the fewest fainted
POKéMON wins.

If tied, the team
that lost the

least amount of HP
wins.

SPECIAL



FISH

This weak and
pathetic POKéMON
gets easily pushed

along rivers when
there are strong
currents.


ATROCIOUS

It appears when-
ever there is
world conflict,

burning down any
place it travels
through.


TRANSPORT

This gentle
POKéMON loves to
give people rides

and provides a ve-
ry comfortable way
to get around.


TRANSFORM

When it encount-
ers another DITTO,
it will move

faster than normal
to duplicate that
opponent exactly.


EVOLUTION

Its ability to
evolve into many
forms allows it to

adapt smoothly
and perfectly to
any environment.


BUBBLE JET

As it uses the
fins on the tip
of its tail to

swim, it blends
with the water
perfectly.


LIGHTNING

The negatively
charged ions
generated in its

fur create a
constant sparking
noise.


FLAME

Once it has stored
up enough heat,
this POKéMON's

body temperature
can reach up to
1700 degrees.


VIRTUAL

An artificial
POKéMON created
due to extensive

research, it can
perform only what
is in its program.


SPIRAL

In prehistoric
times, it swam on
the sea floor,

eating plankton.
Its fossils are
sometimes found.


SPIRAL

Its heavy shell
allowed it to
reach only nearby

food. This could
be the reason it
is extinct.


SHELLFISH

Three hundred
million years ago,
it hid on the sea

floor. It also has
eyes on its back
that glow.


SHELLFISH

It was able to
swim quickly thro-
ugh the water by

compactly folding
up its razor-sharp
sickles.


FOSSIL

In prehistoric
times, this
POKéMON flew

freely and
fearlessly through
the skies.


SLEEPING

This POKéMON's
stomach is so
strong, even

eating moldy or
rotten food will
not affect it.


FREEZE

Legendary bird
POKéMON. As it
flies through the

sky, it cools the
air, causing snow
to fall.


ELECTRIC

Legendary bird
POKéMON. They say
lightning caused

by the flapping of
its wings causes
summer storms.


FLAME

Legendary bird
POKéMON. It is
said to migrate

from the south
along with the
spring.


DRAGON

It sheds many lay-
ers of skin as it
grows larger. Dur-

ing this process,
it is protected by
a rapid waterfall.


DRAGON

It is called the
divine POKéMON.
When its entire

body brightens
slightly, the
weather changes.


DRAGON

It is said that
somewhere in the
ocean lies an

island where these
gather. Only they
live there.


GENETIC
Said to rest qui-
etly in an
undiscovered cave,

this POKéMON was
created solely for
battling.


NEW SPECIE

Because it can
learn any move,
some people began

research to see if
it is the ancestor
of all POKéMON.


LEAF

It loves to bask
in the sunlight.
It uses the leaf

on its head to
seek out warm
places.


LEAF

The scent that
wafts from the
leaves on its neck

causes anyone who
smells it to
become energetic.


HERB

Anyone who stands
beside it becomes
refreshed, just as

if they were
relaxing in a
sunny forest.


FIRE MOUSE

The fire that
spouts from its
back burns hottest

when it is angry.
The flaring flames
intimidate foes.


VOLCANO

Before battle, it
turns its back on
its opponent to

demonstrate how
ferociously its
fire blazes.


VOLCANO

When heat from its
body causes the
air around it to

shimmer, this is a
sign that it is
ready to battle.


BIG JAW

This rough critter
chomps at any
moving object it

sees. Turning your
back on it is not
recommended.

BIG JAW

The tips of its
fangs are slanted
backward. Once

those fangs clamp
down, the prey has
no hope of escape.


BIG JAW

Although it has a
massive body, its
powerful hind legs

enable it to move
quickly, even on
the ground.


SCOUT

When acting as a
lookout, it warns
others of danger

by screeching and
hitting the ground
with its tail.


LONG BODY

It lives in narrow
burrows that fit
its slim body. The

deeper the nests
go, the more maze-
like they become.


OWL

It begins to hoot
at the same time
every day. Some

trainers use them
in place of
clocks.


OWL

Its extremely soft
feathers make no
sound in flight.

It silently sneaks
up on prey without
being detected.


FIVE STAR

It is timid and
clusters together
with others. The

fluid secreted by
its feet indicates
its location.


FIVE STAR

In the daytime
when it gets warm,
it curls up inside

a big leaf and
drifts off into
a deep slumber.


STRINGSPIT

If prey becomes
ensnared in its
nest of spun

string, it waits
motionlessly until
it becomes dark.


LONG LEG

Rather than mak-
ing a nest in one
specific spot, it

wanders in search
of food after
darkness falls.


BAT

As a result of its
pursuit of faster,
yet more silent

flight, a new set
of wings grew on
its hind legs.


ANGLER

Its antennae, whi-
ch evolved from a
fin, have both po-

sitive and neg-
ative charges flo-
wing through them.


LIGHT

This POKéMON uses
the bright part of
its body, which

changed from a
dorsal fin, to
lure prey.


TINY MOUSE

It is unskilled at
storing electric
power. Any kind of

shock causes it to
discharge energy
spontaneously.


STARSHAPE

If the impact site
of a meteorite is
found, this

POKéMON is certain
to be within the
immediate area.


BALLOON

Instead of walking
with its short
legs, it moves

around by bouncing
on its soft,
tender body.


SPIKE BALL

It is considered
to be a symbol of
good luck. Its

shell is said to
be filled with
happiness.


HAPPINESS

Although it does
not flap its wings
very much, it can

stay up in the air
as it tags along
after its trainer.


LITTLE BIRD

It is extremely
good at climbing
tree trunks and

likes to eat the
new sprouts on
the trees.


MYSTIC

Once it begins to
meditate at sun-
rise, the entire

day will pass
before it will
move again.


WOOL

It stores lots of
air in its soft
fur, allowing it

to stay cool in
summer and warm
in winter.


WOOL

Because of its
rubbery, electric-
ity-resistant

skin, it can store
lots of electric-
ity in its fur.


LIGHT

When it gets dark,
the light from its
bright, shiny tail

can be seen from
far away on the
ocean's surface.


FLOWER

When these dance
together, their
petals rub against

each other,
making pretty,
relaxing sounds.

AQUAMOUSE

The fur on its
body naturally
repels water. It

can stay dry, even
when it plays in
the water.


AQUARABBIT

The bubble-like
pattern on its
stomach helps it

camouflage itself
when it's in the
water.


IMITATION

If a tree branch
shakes when there
is no wind, it's a

SUDOWOODO, not a
tree. It hides
from the rain.


FROG

When it expands
its throat to
croak out a tune,

nearby POLIWAG and
POLIWHIRL gather
immediately.


COTTONWEED

It can be carried
away on even the
gentlest breeze.

It may even float
all the way to the
next town.


COTTONWEED

As soon as it
rains, it closes
its flower and

hides in the shade
of a tree to avoid
getting wet.


COTTONWEED

Even in the fierc-
est wind, it can
control its fluff

to make its way to
any place in the
world it wants.


LONG TAIL

It uses its tail
to hang on to tree
branches. It uses

its momentum to
swing from one
branch to another.


SEED

It is very weak.
Its only means of
defense is to

shake its leaves
desperately at its
attacker.


SUN

As the hot season
approaches, the
petals on this

POKéMON's face
become more vivid
and lively.


CLEAR WING

It can see in all
directions without
moving its big

eyes, helping it
spot attackers and
food right away.


WATER FISH

A mucous
membrane covers
its body. Touching

it barehanded will
cause a shooting
pain.


WATER FISH

Its body is always
slimy. It often
bangs its head on

the river bottom
as it swims but
seems not to care.


SUN

The tip of its
forked tail
quivers when it is

predicting its
opponent's next
move.


MOONLIGHT
On the night of a
full moon, or when
it gets excited,

the ring patterns
on its body glow
yellow.


DARKNESS

It hides any shiny
object it finds in
a secret location.

MURKROW and
MEOWTH loot one
another's stashes.


ROYAL

Every time it ya-
wns, SHELLDER
injects more poi-

son into it. The
poison makes it
more intelligent.


SCREECH

It loves to watch
people it's scar-
ed. It frightens

them by screaming
loudly or appear-
ing suddenly.


SYMBOL

Because different
types of UNOWN
exist, it is said

that they must
have a variety of
abilities.


PATIENT

In order to con-
ceal its black
tail, it lives in

a dark cave and
only moves about
at night.


LONG NECK

When it is in
danger, its tail
uses some sort of

mysterious powers
to drive away the
enemy.


BAGWORM

It spits out a
fluid that it uses
to glue tree bark

to its body. The
fluid hardens when
it touches air.


BAGWORM

Usually found
hanging on to a
fat tree trunk. It

shoots out bits of
its shell when it
sees action.


LAND SNAKE

It hides deep
inside caves where
no light ever

reaches it and
remains virtually
motionless there.


FLYSCORPIO

It builds its nest
on a steep cliff.
When it is done

gliding, it hops
along the ground
back to its nest.


IRON SNAKE

The many small
metal particles
that cover this

POKéMON's body
reflect bright
light well.


FAIRY

In truth, it is a
cowardly POKéMON.
It growls eagerly

in order to hide
its fear from its
opponent.


FAIRY

It can make most
any POKéMON run
away simply by

opening its mouth
wide to reveal its
big fangs.


BALLOON

When faced with a
larger opponent,
it swallows as

much water as it
can to match the
opponent's size.


SCISSORS

This POKéMON's
pincers, which
contain steel, can

crush any hard
object it gets a
hold of into bits.


MOLD

The fluid secreted
by its toes carves
holes in rocks for

nesting and can be
mixed with BERRIES
to make a drink.


SINGLEHORN

With its Herculean
powers, it can
easily throw arou-

nd an object that
is 100 times its
own weight.


SHARP CLAW

This cunning
POKéMON hides
under the cover

of darkness,
waiting to attack
its prey.


LITTLE BEAR

It always licks
honey. Its palm
tastes sweet

because of all the
honey it has
absorbed.


HIBERNANT

Although it has a
large body, it is
quite skilled at

climbing trees. It
eats and sleeps in
the treetops.


LAVA

These group to-
gether in areas
that are hotter

than normal. If it
cools off, its
skin hardens.


LAVA

Its body is as hot
as lava and is
always billowing.

Flames will
occasionally burst
from its shell.


PIG

It uses the tip of
its nose to dig
for food. Its nose

is so tough that
even frozen ground
poses no problem.


SWINE

Although its legs
are short, its
rugged hooves

prevent it from
slipping, even on
icy ground.


CORAL

The points on its
head absorb
nutrients from

clean water. They
cannot survive in
polluted water.


JET

To escape from an
attacker, it may
shoot water out of

its mouth, then
use that force to
swim backward.


JET

Its instinct is to
bury itself in
holes. It often

steals the nesting
holes of others to
sleep in them.


DELIVERY

It always carries
its food with it,
wherever it goes.

If attacked, it
throws its food at
the opponent.


KITE

It swims along
freely, eating
things that swim

into its mouth.
Its whole body is
very coarse.


ARMOR BIRD

The feathers that
it sheds are very
sharp. It is said

that people once
used the feathers
as swords.


DARK

Around dawn, its
ominous howl
echoes through the

area to announce
that this is its
territory.


DARK

The pungent-
smelling flame
that shoots from

its mouth results
from toxins burn-
ing in its body.


DRAGON

It stores energy
by sleeping at
underwater depths

at which no other
life forms can
survive.


LONG NOSE

During the desert-
ed morning hours,
it comes ashore

where it deftly
uses its trunk to
take a shower.


ARMOR

Because this
POKéMON's skin is
so tough, a normal

attack won't even
leave a scratch on
it.


VIRTUAL

This manmade
POKéMON evolved
from the latest

technology. It
may have unprog-
rammed reactions.


BIG HORN

The round balls
found on the
fallen antlers can

be ground into a
powder that aids
in sleeping.


PAINTER

The color of the
mysterious fluid
secreted from its

tail is predeter-
mined for each
SMEARGLE.


SCUFFLE

To brush up on its
fighting skills,
it will challenge

anyone. It has a
very strong com-
petitive spirit.


HANDSTAND

After doing a
handstand to
throw off the

opponent's timing,
it presents its
fancy kick moves.


KISS

The sensitivity of
its lips develops
most quickly.

It uses them to
try to identify
unknown objects.


ELECTRIC

It loves violent
thunder. The space
between its horns

flickers bluish-
white when it is
charging energy.


LIVE COAL

It naturally spits
an 1100-degree
flame. It is said

when many appear,
it heralds a
volcanic eruption.


MILK COW

In order to milk a
MILTANK, one must
have a knack for

rhythmically pull-
ing up and down
on its udders.


HAPPINESS

Biting into one
of the delicious
eggs that BLISSEY

provides will make
everyone around
smile with joy.


THUNDER

This rough POKéMON
stores energy
inside its body,

then sweeps across
the land, shooting
off electricity.


VOLCANO

This brawny
POKéMON courses
around the earth,

spouting flames
hotter than a
volcano's magma.


AURORA

This divine
POKéMON blows
around the world,

always in search
of a pure
reservoir.


ROCK SKIN

Born deep under-
ground, this
POKéMON becomes a

pupa after eating
enough dirt to
make a mountain.


HARD SHELL

It will not stay
still, even while
it's a pupa. It

already has arms
and legs under its
solid shell.


ARMOR
In just one of its
mighty hands, it
has the power to

make the ground
shake and moun-
tains crumble.


DIVING

It has an incred-
ible ability to
calm raging sto-

rms. It is said
that LUGIA appears
when storms start.


RAINBOW

It will reveal
itself before a
pure-hearted

trainer by shining
its bright rain-
bow-colored wings.


TIMETRAVEL

Revered as a
guardian of the
forest, CELEBI

appears wherever
beautiful forests
exist.

Get ready to be

You want to be a
leader?

Let me battle you,

You need another
ten years of

training to get
better, I'd say.


You're incredibly
talented.

No one can touch
you now!



Today, I'm going
to whomp you.


I knew I'd win.
I'm so great!


Uh? My plans are
out of whack...

You've got a long
way to go.

Well, keep trying!
Best of luck!


Aww... Don't lose
after beating me.



Who are you?
I don't know you...


I must've imagined
that.

There seems to be
no one here...


Who am I?
I don't know...



Um... Are you that...
um...person?


It doesn't appear
to be you...


Then you really
are the legendary...



I heard that
you're hot!


Not bad. I was
just a bit better.


Eh, you're not
that special.



I'm scared about
what might happen.

My POKéMON are way
too strong.


See? My POKéMON
were too strong.


Graa! My POKéMON
were total wimps!



Hey, there!
I'll take you on!


Don't you have a
better strategy?


You've got decent
style!



I wonder if I can
battle properly...


Um... Sorry...
I think I won.


I guess I'm not
good enough yet...



Wrrooar!
I won't lose!


Wrrooar! I knew
I was a genius!


Arrooh! I hate it
when I lose!



Sorry, but I'm
going to win.


Yeah! My POKéMON
rule!


Oh, close! I lost
by just a bit!



OK, I'm not
fooling around!


Yay! Too easy!
Like, no way!


No!
Like, no way!



Look! My POKéMON
are really cute!


Aren't they really
adorable?


I'm sorry, it's
all my fault!



Let's get our
battle started!


Was I too strong
for you?


Ooh, you're in a
different class.



Are we going to
battle? Let's!


Oh, you're too
weak. Shame.


Wow! Are you quite
satisfied?



Oh, you have some
rare POKéMON.


May I have one of
your POKéMON?


...I want one of
your POKéMON.



Want to hear about
my cute POKéMON?


What do you think
about my cuties?


Oh! My! You're a
dreadful trainer!



Battle? Sure!
Right now!


Oh, I love it!
Battling is wild!


Oh, how rude! Wait
till next time!



Please let me win!
Please?


Wow, thank you!
You're so nice!


You're mean!
I hate meanies!



Well, can we
begin?


Well, I beg your
pardon...


Sob... That's not
fair!



I'm good!
You can't win.


Giving up? You're
pretty weak!


I won't accept
this... No way!



Are you treating
this seriously?


Oh, sorry! Looks
like I won!


Oh, how nasty!
You were serious!



Ahahah! I'll take
it easy on you!


Oops, sorry! But
I'm happy too!


Oh, oh, I lost!
Thanks. Bye!



BATTLE TOWER is a
tough place!


You might have a
hard time.


Ooh, you might
make a run here!



I want to see your
style in action!


Every battle is a
drama!


Oh... Want to trade
something?



OK, here goes!
I have momentum!


See, I rolled
