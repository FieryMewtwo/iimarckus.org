Bingo! The CARD KEY
opened the door!


Darn! It needs a
CARD KEY!


Not even a nibble!


Looks like there's
nothing here.


Oh!
It's a bite!


Ground rose up
somewhere!


This requires
STRENGTH to move!


All your item
needs fulfilled!

POKéMON MART


Heal Your POKéMON!
POKéMON CENTER


NINTEN found
{1.CF4A}!


No more room for
items!


Hi! Remember me?
I'm PROF.OAK's
AIDE!

If you caught {9.FFDB.13}
kinds of POKéMON,
I'm supposed to
give you an
{1.CC5B}!

So, NINTEN! Have
you caught at
least {9.FFDB.13} kinds of
POKéMON?


Let's see...
Uh-oh! You have
caught only {9.FFDD.13}
kinds of POKéMON!

You need {9.FFDB.13} kinds
if you want the
{1.CC5B}.


Oh. I see.

When you get {9.FFDB.13}
kinds, come back
for {1.CC5B}.


Great! You have
caught {9.FFDD.13} kinds
of POKéMON!
Congratulations!

Here you go!


NINTEN got the
{1.CC5B}!


Oh! I see you
don't have any
room for the
{1.CC5B}.


CHANSEY: Chaaan
sey!


I came here with
some friends!

They're out for
POKéMON fights!


Hey! You have
POKéMON! Come on!
Let's battle 'em!


No!
CATERPIE can't
cut it!


Ssh! You'll scare
the bugs away!


Yo! You can't jam
out if you're a
POKéMON trainer!


Huh?
I ran out of
POKéMON!


Darn! I'm going
to catch some
stronger ones!


Hey, wait up!
What's the hurry?


I
give! You're good
at this!


Sometimes, you
can find stuff on
the ground!

I'm looking for
the stuff I
dropped!


Hi, do you have a
PIKACHU?


Oh no,
really?


I looked forever,
but I never found
a PIKACHU here!


I'm gonna be the
best. You just
can't beat me!


After
all I did...


A METAPOD is cool
because its
attack is its
defense!


I ran out of POKé
BALLs to catch
POKéMON with!

You should carry
extras!


TRAINER TIPS

If you want to
avoid battles,
stay away from
grassy areas!


For poison, use
ANTIDOTE! Get it
at POKéMON MARTs!


TRAINER TIPS

Contact PROF.OAK
via PC to get
your POKéDEX
evaluated!


TRAINER TIPS

No stealing of
POKéMON from
other trainers!
Catch only wild
POKéMON!


TRAINER TIPS

Weaken POKéMON
before attempting
capture!

When healthy,
they may escape!


LEAVING
VIRIDIAN FOREST
PEWTER CITY AHEAD


WHOA! You shocked
me! Oh, you're
just a kid!


Wow!
Shocked again!


Kids like you
shouldn't be
here!


Did you come to
explore too?


Losing
stinks!


I came down here
to show off to
girls.


Wow! It's way
bigger in here
than I thought!


Oh!
I lost it!


How do you get
out of here?


What! Don't sneak
up on me!


My
POKéMON won't do!


I have to find
stronger POKéMON.


What? I'm waiting
for my friends to
find me here.


I lost?


I heard there are
some very rare
fossils here.


Suspicious men
are in the cave.
What about you?


You
got me!


I saw them! I'm
sure they're from
TEAM ROCKET!


Go through this
cave to get to
CERULEAN CITY!


I
lost.


ZUBAT is tough!
But, it can be
useful if you
catch one.


Beware! ZUBAT is
a bloodsucker!





Stop right there!


That fossil is
TEAM ROCKET's!

Surrender now, or
prepare to fight!


A
brat beat us?


TEAM ROCKET, blast
off at the speed
of light!


You want the
DOME FOSSIL?


You want the
HELIX FOSSIL?


NINTEN got the
{1.CF4A}!


Look, you've got
no room for this.


Hey, stop!

I found these
fossils! They're
both mine!


OK!
I'll share!


We'll each take
one!
No being greedy!


Far away, on
CINNABAR ISLAND,
there's a POKéMON
LAB.

They do research
on regenerating
fossils.


All right. Then
this is mine!


We, TEAM ROCKET,
are POKéMON
gangsters!


I blew
it!


Darn it all! My
associates won't
stand for this!


We're pulling a
big job here!
Get lost, kid!


So, you
are good.


If you find a
fossil, give it
to me and scram!


Little kids
should leave
grown-ups alone!


I'm
steamed!


POKéMON lived
here long before
people came.


Bonjour!
I am le waiter on
this ship!

I will be happy
to serve you any-
thing you please!

Ah! Le strong
silent type!


The passengers
are restless!

You might be
challenged by the
more bored ones!


This ship, she is
a luxury liner
for trainers!

At every port, we
hold parties with
invited trainers!


SONY: Bonjour!
NINTEN!

Imagine seeing
you here!

NINTEN, were you
really invited?

So how's your
POKéDEX coming?

I already caught
40 kinds, pal!

Different kinds
are everywhere!

Crawl around in
grassy areas!


Humph!

At least you're
raising your
POKéMON!


NINTEN! What are
you, seasick?

You should shape
up, pal!


SONY: I heard
there was a CUT
master on board.

But, he was just a
seasick, old man!

But, CUT itself is
really useful!

You should go see
him! Smell ya!


Our CAPTAIN is a
sword master!

He even teaches
CUT to POKéMON!


The party's over.
The ship will be
departing soon.


Scrubbing decks
is hard work!


Urf. I feel ill.

I stepped out to
get some air.


Hey matey!

Let's do a little
jig!


You're
impressive!


How many kinds of
POKéMON do you
think there are?


Ahoy there!
Are you seasick?


I was
just careless!


My Pa said there
are 100 kinds of
POKéMON. I think
there are more.


You, mon petit!
We're busy here!
Out of the way!


I saw an odd ball
in the trash.


I'm so busy I'm
getting dizzy!


Hum-de-hum-de-
ho...

I peel spuds
every day!
Hum-hum...


Did you hear about
SNORLAX?

All it does is
eat and sleep!


Snivel...Sniff...

I only get to
peel onions...
Snivel...


Er-hem! Indeed I
am le CHEF!

Le main course is


Salade de Salmon!

Les guests may
gripe it's fish
again, however!


Eels au Barbecue!

Les guests will
mutiny, I fear.


Prime Beef Steak!

But, have I enough
fillets du beef?


CAPTAIN: Ooargh...
I feel hideous...
Urrp! Seasick...

NINTEN rubbed
the CAPTAIN's
back!

Rub-rub...
Rub-rub...


CAPTAIN: Whew!
Thank you! I
feel much better!

You want to see
my CUT technique?

I could show you
if I wasn't ill...

I know! You can
have this!

Teach it to your
POKéMON and you
can see it CUT
anytime!


NINTEN got
{50}!


CAPTAIN: Whew!

Now that I'm not
sick anymore, I
guess it's time.


Oh no! You have
no room for this!


Yuck! Shouldn't
have looked!


How to Conquer
Seasickness...
The CAPTAIN's
reading this!


WIGGLYTUFF: Puup
pupuu!


I travel alone
on my journeys!

My POKéMON are my
only friends!


My, my
friends...


You should be
nice to friends!


You pup! How dare
you barge in!


Humph!
You rude child!


I wish to be left
alone! Get out!


I love POKéMON!
Do you?


Wow!
You're great!


Let me be your
friend, OK?

Then we can trade
POKéMON!


I collected these
POKéMON from all
around the world!


Oh no!
I went around the
world for these!


You hurt my poor
worldly POKéMON!

I demand that you
heal them at a
POKéMON CENTER!


Waiter, I would
like a cherry pie
please!


A cruise is so
elegant yet cozy!


I always travel
with WIGGLYTUFF!


We are cruising
around the world.


Ssh! I'm a GLOBAL
POLICE agent!

I'm on the trail
of TEAM ROCKET!


In all my travels,
I've never seen
any POKéMON sleep
like this one!

It was something
like this!


Ah yes, I have
seen some POKéMON
ferry people
across the water!


POKéMON can CUT
down small bushes.


Competing against
the young keeps
me youthful.


Good
fight! Ah, I feel
young again!


15 years ago, I
would have won!


Check out what I
fished up!


I'm
all out!


Party?

The cruise ship's
party should be
over by now.


Which do you like,
a strong or a
rare POKéMON?


I must
salute you!


I prefer strong
and rare POKéMON.


I never saw you
at the party.


Take
it easy!


Oh, I adore your
strong POKéMON!


Have you gone to
the SAFARI ZONE
in FUCHSIA CITY?

It had many rare
kinds of POKéMON!!


Me and my Daddy
think the SAFARI
ZONE is awesome!


The CAPTAIN looked
really sick and
pale!


I hear many people
get seasick!


MACHOKE: Gwoh!
Goggoh!


You know what they
say about sailors
and fighting!


Right!
Good fight, mate!


Haha! Want to be
a sailor, mate?


My sailor's pride
is at stake!


Your
spirit sank me!


Did you see the
FISHING GURU in
VERMILION CITY?


Us sailors have
POKéMON too!


OK,
you're not bad.


We caught all our
POKéMON while
out at sea!


I like feisty
kids like you!


Argh!
Lost it!


Sea POKéMON live
in deep water.
You'll need a ROD!


Matey, you're
walking the plank
if you lose!


Argh!
Beaten by a kid!


Jellyfish some-
times drift into
the ship.


Hello stranger!
Stop and chat!

All my POKéMON
are from the sea!


Darn!
I let that one
get away!


I was going to
make you my
assistant too!


My buddy, MACHOKE,
is super strong!

He has enough
STRENGTH to move
big rocks!


I heard rumors of
a child prodigy!


The
rumors were true!


You beat GIOVANNI
of TEAM ROCKET?


I'll show you just
how good you are!


I'm
furious!


You showed me just
how good I was!


Only the chosen
can pass here!


I
don't believe it!


All trainers here
are headed to the
POKéMON LEAGUE!
Be careful!


Trainers live to
seek stronger
opponents!


Oh!
So strong!


By fighting tough
battles, you get
stronger!


Why...?


Who are you? How
did you get here?


Oww!
Beaten!


Are you dissing
TEAM ROCKET?


You broke into
our operation?


Burnt!


You're not going
to get away with
this, brat!


Intruder alert!


I
can't do it!


SILPH SCOPE?
I don't know
where it is!


Why did you come
here?


This
won't do!


OK, I'll talk!
Take the elevator
to see my BOSS!


Are you lost, you
little rat?


Uh-oh, that fight
opened the door!


BOSS said you can
see GHOSTs with
the SILPH SCOPE!


I
surrender!


The TEAM ROCKET
HQ has 4 basement
floors. Can you
reach the BOSS?


Stop meddling in
TEAM ROCKET's
affairs!


Oof!
Taken down!


SILPH SCOPE?
The machine the
BOSS stole. It's
here somewhere.


We got word from
upstairs that you
were coming!


What?
I lost? No!


Go ahead and go!
But, you need the
LIFT KEY to run
the elevator!


Not another step,
brat!


How dare you
humiliate us at
MT.MOON!

It's payback time,
you brat!


Such
a dreadful twerp!


Looks like TEAM
ROCKET's blasting
off again!


So! I must say, I
am impressed you
got here!


WHAT!
This cannot be!


I see that you
raise POKéMON
with utmost care.

A child like you
would never
understand what I
hope to achieve.

I shall step
aside this time!

I hope we meet
again...


The elevator
doesn't work? Who
has the LIFT KEY?


No!


Oh no! I dropped
the LIFT KEY!


It appears to
need a key.


Eeek!
No! Stop! Help!

Oh, you're not
with TEAM ROCKET.
I thought...
I'm sorry. Here,
please take this!


NINTEN got
{1.CF4A}!


TM36 is
SELFDESTRUCT!

It's powerful, but
the POKéMON that
uses it faints!
Be careful.


You don't have any
room for this.


Help! I'm a SILPH
employee.


How
did you know I
was a ROCKET?


I work for both
SILPH and TEAM
ROCKET!


It's off limits
here! Go home!


You're
good.


Can you solve the
maze in here?


No kids are
allowed in here!


Tough!


Diamond-shaped
tiles are
teleport blocks!

They're hi-tech
transporters!


Hey kid! What are
you doing here?


I goofed!


SILPH CO. will
be merged with
TEAM ROCKET!


I work for SILPH.
What should I do?


NINTEN! You and
your POKéMON
saved us!


Quit messing with
us, kid!


I give
up!


A hint? You can
open doors with a
CARD KEY!


I support TEAM
ROCKET more than
I support SILPH!


You
really got me!


Humph...

TEAM ROCKET said
that if I helped
them, they'd let
me study POKéMON!


Sssh! Can't you
see I'm hiding?


Huh? TEAM ROCKET
is gone?


TEAM ROCKET has
taken command of
SILPH CO.!


Arrgh!


Fwahahaha!
My BOSS has been
after this place!


My POKéMON are my
loyal soldiers!


Darn!
You weak POKéMON!


The doors are
electronically
locked! A CARD
KEY opens them!


Intruder spotted!


Who
are you?


I better tell the
BOSS on 11F!


TEAM ROCKET is
in an uproar over
some intruder.
That's you right?


TEAM ROCKET took
off! You're our
hero! Thank you!


I heard a kid was
wandering around.


Boom!


It's not smart
to pick a fight
with TEAM ROCKET!


We study POKé
BALL technology
on this floor!


Dang!
Blast it!


We worked on the
ultimate POKé
BALL which would
catch anything!


Whaaat? There
shouldn't be any
children here!


Oh
goodness!


You're only on 5F.
It's a long way
to my BOSS!


Show TEAM ROCKET
a little respect!


Cough...
Cough...


Which reminds me.

KOFFING evolves
into WEEZING!


It's a POKéMON
REPORT!

POKéMON LAB
created PORYGON,
the first virtual
reality POKéMON.


It's a POKéMON
REPORT!

Over 160 POKéMON
techniques have
been confirmed.


It's a POKéMON
REPORT!

4 POKéMON evolve
only when traded
by link-cable.


The ROCKETs came
and took over the
building!


Well, better get
back to work!


Oh dear, oh dear.
Help me please!


We got engaged!
Heheh!


Look at him! He's
such a coward!


I feel so sorry
for him, I have
to marry him!


TEAM ROCKET is
trying to conquer
the world with
POKéMON!


TEAM ROCKET ran
because of you!


They must have
targeted SILPH
for our POKéMON
products.


Come work for
SILPH when you
get older!


I am one of the 4
ROCKET BROTHERS!


Flame
out!


No matter!
My brothers will
avenge me!


That rotten
PRESIDENT!

He shouldn't have
sent me to the
TIKSI BRANCH!


Shoot!


TIKSI BRANCH?
It's in Russian
no man's land!


You dare betray
TEAM ROCKET?


You
traitor!


If you stand for
justice, you
betray evil!


Oh! Hi! You're
not a ROCKET! You
came to save us?
Why, thank you!

I want you to
have this POKéMON
for saving us.


It's LAPRAS. It's
very intelligent.

We kept it in our
lab, but it will
be much better
off with you!

I think you will
be a good trainer
for LAPRAS!

It's a good
swimmer. It'll
give you a lift!


TEAM ROCKET's
BOSS went to the
boardroom! Is our
PRESIDENT OK?


Saved at last!
Thank you!


TEAM ROCKET was
after the MASTER
BALL which will
catch any POKéMON!


We canceled the
MASTER BALL
project because
of TEAM ROCKET.


It would be bad
if TEAM ROCKET
took over SILPH
or our POKéMON!


Wow! You chased
off TEAM ROCKET
all by yourself?


You! It's really
dangerous here!
You came to save
me? You can't!


Safe at last!
Oh thank you!


Aha! I smell a
little rat!


Lights
out!


You won't find my
BOSS by just
scurrying around!


Heheh!

You mistook me for
a SILPH worker?


I'm
done!


Despite your age,
you are a skilled
trainer!


I am one of the 4
ROCKET BROTHERS!


Aack!
Brothers, I lost!


Doesn't matter.
My brothers will
repay the favor!


A child intruder?
That must be you!


Fine!
I lost!


Go on home
before my BOSS
gets ticked off!


SONY: What
kept you NINTEN?


SONY: Hahaha!
I thought you'd
turn up if I
waited here!

I guess TEAM
ROCKET slowed you
down! Not that I
care!

I saw you in
SAFFRON, so I
decided to see if
you got better!


Oh-oh!
So, you are ready
for BOSS ROCKET!


SONY: How can
I put this?

You're not good
enough to play
with us big boys!


Well, NINTEN!

I'm moving on up
and ahead!

By checking my
POKéDEX, I'm
starting to see
what's strong and
how they evolve!

I'm going to the
POKéMON LEAGUE
to boot out the
ELITE FOUR!

I'll become the
world's most
powerful trainer!

NINTEN, well
good luck to you!
Don't sweat it!
Smell ya!


I wonder if SILPH
is finished...


Thanks for saving
us!


That's as far as
you'll go!


Not
enough grit!


If you don't turn
back, I'll call
for backup!


You're causing us
problems!


Huh?
I lost?


So, what do you
think of SILPH
BUILDING's maze?


I am one of the 4
ROCKET BROTHERS!


Whoo!
Oh brothers!


I'll leave you up
to my brothers!


You look tired!
You should take a
quick nap!


Don't give up!


Thank you so
much!


Your POKéMON seem
to adore you, kid!


Ghaaah!


If I had started
as a trainer at
your age...


Your POKéMON have
weak points! I
can nail them!


You
hammered me!


Exploiting weak
spots does work!
Think about
element types!


I am one of the 4
ROCKET BROTHERS!


Warg!
Brothers, I lost!


My brothers will
avenge me!


Waaaaa!
I'm scared!


Please keep quiet
about my crying!


Welcome to the
10F! So good of
you to join me!


I'm
stunned!


Nice try, but the
boardroom is up
one more floor!


Enough of your
silly games!


No
continues left!


Are you satisfied
with beating me?
Then go on home!


Hold it right
there, brat!


Our BOSS is in a
meeting!

You better not
disturb him!


Like
always...


TEAM ROCKET, blast
off at the speed
of light!

Again...



PRESIDENT: Thank
you for saving
SILPH!

I will never
forget you saved
us in our moment
of peril!

I have to thank
you in some way!

Because I am rich,
I can give you
anything!

Here, maybe this
will do!


NINTEN got a
{1.CF4A}!


PRESIDENT: You
can't buy that
anywhere!

It's our secret
prototype MASTER
BALL!

It will catch any
POKéMON without
fail!

You should be
quiet about using
it, though.


You have no
room for this.


SECRETARY: Thank
you for rescuing
all of us!

We admire your
courage.


Ah, NINTEN!
So we meet again!

The PRESIDENT and
I are discussing
a vital business
proposition.

Keep your nose
out of grown-up
matters...

or, experience a
world of pain!


Arrgh!!
I lost again!?


Blast it all!
You ruined our
plans for SILPH!

But, TEAM ROCKET
will never fall!

NINTEN! Never
forget that all
POKéMON exist
for TEAM ROCKET!

I must go, but I
shall return!


Halt! Do you have
an appointment
with my BOSS?


Gaah!
Demolished!


Watch your step,
my BOSS likes his
POKéMON tough!


I can't get out!
This old place is
one big puzzle!


Oh no!
My bag of loot!


Switches open and
close alternating
sets of doors!


Diary: July 5
Guyana,
South America

A new POKéMON was
discovered deep
in the jungle.


Diary: July 10
We christened the
newly discovered
POKéMON, MEW.


A secret switch!

Press it?


Who wouldn't?


Not quite yet!


This place is
like, huge!


Ayah!


I wonder where
my partner went.


My mentor once
lived here.


Whew!
Overwhelming!


So, you're stuck?
Try jumping off
over there!


Diary: Feb. 6
MEW gave birth.

We named the
newborn MEWTWO.


Uh-oh. Where am
I now?


Awooh!


You can find stuff
lying around.


This place is
ideal for a lab.


What
was that for?


I like it here!
It's conducive to
my studies!


Diary; Sept. 1
MEWTWO is far too
powerful.

We have failed to
curb its vicious
tendencies...

Ah! Finally!

You're the first

I was getting
worried that no

Congratulations!
You have won!


NINTEN received

POKéMON will be

Tossing ROCKs at
POKéMON might

Using BAIT will

I hiked a lot, but
I didn't see any

How many did you

I caught a

That makes this

I
lost out!


I never wanted to
lose to anybody!


I can see you're
good! Let me see
exactly how good!


I
had a chance...


I concede, you're
better than me!


Ah! I heard about
you, NINTEN!

I lead the ELITE
FOUR! You can
call me LANCE the
dragon trainer!

You know that
dragons are
mythical POKéMON!

They're hard to
catch and raise,
but their powers
are superior!

They're virtually
indestructible!

Well, are you
ready to lose?

Your LEAGUE
challenge ends
with me, NINTEN!


That's it!

I hate to admit
it, but you are a
POKéMON master!


I still can't
believe my
dragons lost to
you, NINTEN!

You are now the
POKéMON LEAGUE
champion!

...Or, you would
have been, but
you have one more
challenge ahead.

You have to face
another trainer!
His name is...

SONY!
He beat the ELITE
FOUR before you!

He is the real
POKéMON LEAGUE
champion!


OAK: Er-hem!
Congratulations,
NINTEN!

This floor is the
POKéMON HALL OF
FAME!

POKéMON LEAGUE
champions are
honored for their
exploits here!

Their POKéMON are
also recorded in
the HALL OF FAME!

NINTEN! You have
endeavored hard
to become the new
LEAGUE champion!

Congratulations,
NINTEN, you and
your POKéMON are
HALL OF FAMERs!


SONY: Hey!

I was looking
forward to seeing
you, NINTEN!

My rival should
be strong to keep
me sharp!

While working on
POKéDEX, I looked
all over for
powerful POKéMON!

Not only that, I
assembled teams
that would beat
any POKéMON type!

And now!

I'm the POKéMON
LEAGUE champion!

NINTEN! Do you
know what that
means?

I'll tell you!

I am the most
powerful trainer
in the world!


NO!
That can't be!
You beat my best!

After all that
work to become
LEAGUE champ?

My reign is over
already?
It's not fair!


Hahaha!
I won, I won!

I'm too good for
you, NINTEN!

You did well to
even reach me,
SONY, the
POKéMON genius!

Nice try, loser!
Hahaha!


Why?
Why did I lose?

I never made any
mistakes raising
my POKéMON...

Darn it! You're
the new POKéMON
LEAGUE champion!

Although I don't
like to admit it.


OAK: NINTEN!


OAK: So, you won!
Congratulations!
You're the new
POKéMON LEAGUE
champion!

You've grown up so
much since you
first left with
{1.CD6D}!

NINTEN, you have
come of age!


OAK: SONY! I'm
disappointed!

I came when I
heard you beat
the ELITE FOUR!

But, when I got
here, you had
already lost!

SONY! Do you
understand why
you lost?

You have forgotten
to treat your
POKéMON with
trust and love!

Without them, you
will never become
a champ again!


OAK: NINTEN!

You understand
that your victory
was not just your
own doing!

The bond you share
with your POKéMON
is marvelous!

NINTEN!
Come with me!


Welcome to
POKéMON LEAGUE!

I am LORELEI of
the ELITE FOUR!

No one can best
me when it comes
to icy POKéMON!

Freezing moves
are powerful!

Your POKéMON will
be at my mercy
when they are
frozen solid!

Hahaha!
Are you ready?


How
dare you!


You're better
than I thought!
Go on ahead!

You only got a
taste of POKéMON
LEAGUE power!


Someone's voice:
Don't run away!


I am BRUNO of
the ELITE FOUR!

Through rigorous
training, people
and POKéMON can
become stronger!

I've weight
trained with
my POKéMON!

NINTEN!

We will grind you
down with our
superior power!

Hoo hah!


Why?
How could I lose?


My job is done!
Go face your next
challenge!


Someone's voice:
Don't run away!


I am AGATHA of
the ELITE FOUR!

OAK's taken a lot
of interest in
you, child!

That old duff was
once tough and
handsome! That
was decades ago!

Now he just wants
to fiddle with
his POKéDEX! He's
wrong! POKéMON
are for fighting!

NINTEN! I'll show
you how a real
trainer fights!


Woo-hoo!
You're something
special, child!


You win! I see
what the old duff
sees in you now!

I have nothing
else to say! Run
along now, child!


Someone's voice:
Don't run away!

Ohhh!

Hahaha! Can you

Oops!

because I hate
thinking!


You have a
POKéDEX?
I want one too!


Shoot!
I'm so jealous!


When you finish
your POKéDEX, can
I have it?


Do you know about

Well,
that's that.


Costume players

My POKéMON

I give!
You're a better

In mountains,
you'll often find
rock-type POKéMON.


I don't often

will fight you.


Oh!
I lost!


I like tiny
POKéMON, big ones
are too scary!


Hit me with your
best shot!


Fired

I'll raise my

It is true that a
higher level
POKéMON will be
more powerful...

But, all POKéMON
will have weak
points against
specific types.

So, there is no
universally
strong POKéMON.


If I had a BIKE,
I would go to
CYCLING ROAD!


If you're studying 
POKéMON, visit
the SAFARI ZONE.

It has all sorts
of rare POKéMON.


POKéMON can still
learn techniques
after canceling
evolution.

Evolution can wait
until new moves
have been learned.


It would be great

Hello there!
Welcome to the
world of POKéMON!

My name is OAK!
People call me
the POKéMON PROF!


This world is
inhabited by
creatures called
POKéMON!




For some people,
POKéMON are
pets. Others use
them for fights.

Myself...

I study POKéMON
as a profession.


First, what is
your name?


This is my grand-
son. He's been
your rival since
you were a baby.

...Erm, what is
his name again?


NINTEN!

Your very own
POKéMON legend is
about to unfold!

A world of dreams
and adventures
with POKéMON
awaits! Let's go!


Do you want to
give a nickname
to {5A}?


Right! So your
name is NINTEN!


That's right! I
remember now! His
name is SONY!


{5A} and
{90} will
be traded.


You need 3 POKéMON
to fight!


Sorry, MEW can't
attend!


Your POKéMON must
all be different!


No POKéMON can
exceed L55!


All POKéMON must
be at least L50!


Your total levels
exceed 155!


No POKéMON can
exceed L30!


All POKéMON must
be at least L25!


Your total levels
exceed 80!


No POKéMON can

All POKéMON must
be at least L15!


Your total levels

{5A} is over
68 tall!


{5A} weighs
over 44 pounds!


{5A} is an
evolved POKéMON!


Your opponent is
ineligible.


Where would you
like to go?

[4B]


There are no
POKéMON here!


I went to ROCK
TUNNEL, but it's
dark and scary.

If a POKéMON's
FLASH could light
it up...


Many POKéMON live
only in forests 
and caves.

You need to look
everywhere to get
different kinds!


Have you noticed
the bushes on the
roadside?

They can be cut
down by a special
POKéMON move.


A fainted POKéMON
can't fight. But, 
it can still use 
moves like CUT!


The HM FLASH
lights even the
darkest dungeons.


Once a POKéMON
learns FLASH, you
can get through
ROCK TUNNEL.


Are you going to
VIRIDIAN FOREST?
Be careful, it's
a natural maze!


You have to roam
far to get new
kinds of POKéMON.

Look for other
types outside of
VIRIDIAN FOREST.


I've 6 POKé BALLs
set in my belt.

At most, you can
carry 6 POKéMON.


TEAM ROCKET

citizens...

TEAM ROCKET is
always in the
news!





MAN: Hello, there!
Have I got a deal
just for you!

I'll let you have
a swell MAGIKARP
for just ¥500!
What do you say?


No? I'm only
doing this as a
favor to you!


You'll need more
money than that!


MAN: Well, I don't
give refunds!


I'm on guard duty.
Gee, I'm thirsty,
though!

Oh, wait there,
the road's closed.


Whoa, boy!
I'm parched!
...
Huh? I can have
this drink?
Gee, thanks!




...
Glug, glug...
...
Gulp...
If you want to go
to SAFFRON CITY...
...
You can go on
through. I'll
share this with
the other guards!


Hi, thanks for
the cool drinks!


I run a DAYCARE.
Would you like me
to raise one of
your POKéMON?


Which POKéMON
should I raise?


Fine, I'll look
after {1.CD6D}
for a while.


Come see me in
a while.


Your {1.CD6D}
has grown a lot!

By level, it's
grown by {9.CD3E.13}!

Aren't I great?


You owe me ¥{2.CD3F.C2}
for the return
of this POKéMON.


NINTEN got
{1.DA48} back!


Back already?
Your {1.CD6D}
needs some more
time with me.


All right then,



Come again.


You have no room
for this POKéMON!


You only have one
POKéMON with you.


I can't accept a
POKéMON that
knows an HM move.


Thank you! Here's
your POKéMON!


Hey, you don't
have enough ¥!


People often lose
things in that
UNDERGROUND PATH.


I heard a sleepy
POKéMON appeared
near CELADON CITY.


I want to shop at
the dept. store
in CELADON but...

There are so many
rough looking
people there.


TEAM ROCKET had a
secret hideout in
CELADON CITY?


You're here to
shop in CELADON?

Just step outside
and head west!


The UNDERGROUND
PATH goes beneath
SAFFRON and leads
to LAVENDER.

If you're heading
to CERULEAN, go
to the building
across the road.


The dept. store
in CELADON has a
great selection!


The element types
of POKéMON make
them stronger
than some types
and weaker than
others!


I sold a useless
NUGGET for ¥5000!


This tunnel goes
a long way, kid!


Doh!
You win!


Watch for ONIX!
It can put the
squeeze on you!


Hmm. Maybe I'm
lost in here...


Ease up!
What am I doing?
Which way is out?


That sleeping
POKéMON on ROUTE
12 forced me to
take this detour.


Outsiders like
you need to show
me some respect!


I give!


You're talented
enough to hike!


POKéMON fight!
Ready, go!


Game
over!


Oh well, I'll get
a ZUBAT as I go!


Eek! Don't try
anything funny in
the dark!


It
was too dark!


I saw a MACHOP
in this tunnel!


I came this far
for POKéMON!


I'm
out of POKéMON!


You looked cute
and harmless!


You have POKéMON!
Let's start!


You
play hard!


Whew! I'm all
sweaty now!


ROCK TUNNEL
CERULEAN CITY -
LAVENDER TOWN


Bzzzt!


Gyaoo!


When you catch
lots of POKéMON,
isn't it hard to
think up names?

In LAVENDER TOWN,
there's a man who
rates POKéMON
nicknames.

He'll help you
rename them too!


There are items on
the ground that
can't be seen.

ITEMFINDER will
detect an item
close to you.

It can't pinpoint
it, so you have
to look yourself!


Looked into the
binoculars.

A big POKéMON is
asleep on a road!


Looked into the
binoculars.

It's a beautiful
view!


Looked into the
binoculars.

The only way to
get from CERULEAN
CITY to LAVENDER
is by way of the
ROCK TUNNEL.


What a surprise!
DIGLETTs dug this
long tunnel!

It goes right to
VIRIDIAN CITY!


There's a lookout
spot upstairs.


My POKéMON's
ashes are stored
in POKéMON TOWER.

You can have this
TM. I don't need
it anymore...


NINTEN received
TM39!


TM39 is a move
called SWIFT.

It's very accurate,
so use it during
battles you can't
afford to lose.


You don't have
room for this.


Looked into the
binoculars.

A man fishing!


Looked into the
binoculars.

It's POKéMON TOWER!


I'm the FISHING
GURU's brother!

I simply Looove
fishing!

Do you like to
fish?


Grand! I like
your style!

Take this and
fish, young one!

NINTEN received
a {1.CF4A}!




Fishing is a way
of life!

From the seas to
rivers, go out
and land the big
one!


Oh... That's so
disappointing...


Hello there,
NINTEN!

Use the SUPER ROD
in any water!
You can catch
different kinds
of POKéMON.

Try fishing
wherever you can!


Oh no!

I had a gift for
you, but you have
no room for it!


Are you working
on a POKéDEX?

PROF.OAK's AIDE
came by here.


EXP.ALL gives
EXP points to all
the POKéMON with
you, even if they
don't fight.

It does, however,
reduce the amount
of EXP for each
POKéMON.

If you don't need
it, you should 
store it via PC.


Looked into the
binoculars.

It looks like a
small island!


No pedestrians
are allowed on
CYCLING ROAD!


CYCLING ROAD is a
downhill course
by the sea. It's
a great ride.


Excuse me! Wait
up please!


How'd you get in?
Good effort!


I'm going for a
ride with my girl
friend!


We're going
riding together!


Looked into the
binoculars.

It's CELADON DEPT.
STORE!


Looked into the
binoculars.

There's a long
path over water!


Oh, you found my
secret retreat!

Please don't tell
anyone I'm here.
I'll make it up
to you with this!


NINTEN received
HM02!


HM02 is FLY.
It will take you
back to any town.

Put it to good
use!


You don't have any
room for this.


FEAROW: Kyueen!


You need a BICYCLE
for CYCLING ROAD!


CYCLING ROAD is
all uphill from
here.


Excuse me!


Looked into the
binoculars.

PALLET TOWN is in
the west!


Looked into the
binoculars.

There are people
swimming!


Whoa!

Your PIKACHU knows
how to SURF! So,
I'm not alone...

Great! You earned
the right to SURF
with the DUDE!

Give it a go?


Come SURF anytime,
my friend!


Wanna go SURF?


Dogs and burgers
on special today!


PIKACHU: Pikaa

Gyaoo!


VICTORY ROAD is
the final test
for trainers!


Aiyah!


If you get stuck,
try moving some
boulders around!


Ah, so you wish
to challenge the
ELITE FOUR?


You
got me!


SONY also came
through here!


Come on!
I'll whip you!


I got
whipped!


You earned the
right to be on
VICTORY ROAD!


If you can get
through here, you
can go meet the
ELITE FOUR!


No!
Unbelievable!


I can beat you
when it comes to
knowledge about
POKéMON!


Is VICTORY ROAD
too tough?


Well
done!


Many trainers give
up the challenge
here.


Whoa, don't go
anywhere, wait!


Hiya! I'm a
POKéMON...
...No I'm not!

Call me BILL!
I'm a true blue
POKéMANIAC! Hey!
What's with that
skeptical look?

I'm not joshing
you, I screwed up
an experiment and
got combined with
a POKéMON!

So, how about it?
Help me out here!


When I'm in the
TELEPORTER, go to
my PC and run the
Cell Separation
System!


No!? Come on, you
gotta help a guy
in deep trouble!

What do you say,
chief? Please?
OK? All right!


BILL: Yeehah!
Thanks, bud! I
owe you one!

So, did you come
to see my POKéMON
collection?
You didn't?
That's a bummer.

I've got to thank
you... Oh here,
maybe this'll do.


NINTEN received
an {1.CF4A}!


You've got too
much stuff, bud!


That cruise ship,
S.S.ANNE, is in
VERMILION CITY.
Its passengers
are all trainers!

They invited me
to their party,
but I can't stand
fancy do's. Why
don't you go
instead of me?


BILL: Look, bud,
just check out
some of my rare
POKéMON on my PC!


Hi! I work at a
POKéMON MART.

It's a convenient
shop, so please
visit us in
VIRIDIAN CITY.

I know, I'll give
you a sample!
Here you go!


NINTEN got
{1.CF4A}!


We also carry
POKé BALLs for
catching POKéMON!


You have too much
stuff with you!


See those ledges
along the road?

It's a bit scary,
but you can jump
from them.

You can get back
to PALLET TOWN
quicker that way.

There are other
kinds of POKéMON
than those found
in the forest!


Hi! I like shorts!
They're comfy and
easy to wear!


I don't
believe it!


Are you storing
your POKéMON on
PC? Each BOX can
hold 20 POKéMON!


You looked at me,
didn't you?


You're
mean!


Quit staring if
you don't want to
fight!


Are you a trainer?
Let's fight!


If I
had new POKéMON,
I would've won!


If a POKéMON BOX
on the PC gets
full, just switch
to another BOX!


That look you
gave me, it's so
intriguing!


Be nice!


Avoid fights by
not letting
people see you!


Hey! You're not

Lost!
Lost! Lost!


I always wear

Now I understand,
POKéMON isn't

There aren't many

No!
You're kidding!


I like bugs, so
I'm going back to
VIRIDIAN FOREST.


Huh? You want

I

I should carry

didn't work!

to win at this!


It's

Go with GRIMER
first...and...
...and...then...


I like NIDORAN, so
I collect them!


Why? Why??


When POKéMON grow
up they get ugly!
They shouldn't
evolve!


School is fun, but
so are POKéMON.


I'll
stay with school.


We're stuck here

It's just luck.

I'm the best in

There's a fat

It's strong if
you can get it.


Watch out for

Whoa!

Well, better get

wish to make your
acquaintance.


Wow!
You totally won!


You have to make
POKéMON fight to
toughen them up!


I found CARBOS in
a cave once.


Just
messed up!


CARBOS boosted
the SPEED of my
POKéMON.


The wind's blowing
my way!


The
wind turned!


I'm beat. I guess
I'll FLY home.


Sure, I'll play
with you!


Oh!
You little brute!


I wonder which is
stronger, male or
female POKéMON?


Do you want to
POKéMON with me?


It's over
already?


I don't know
anything about
POKéMON. I just
like cool ones!


What're you
lookin' at?


Dang!
Stripped gears!


Get lost!


I always go with
bird POKéMON!


Out
of power!


I wish I could
fly like PIDGEY
and PIDGEOTTO...

ROUTE 13
North to SILENCE
BRIDGE


You need to use
TMs to teach good
moves to POKéMON!


Not
good enough!


You have some HMs,
right? POKéMON
can't ever forget
those moves.


My bird POKéMON
should be ready
for battle.


Not
ready yet!


They need to learn
better moves.


TMs are on sale
in CELADON!
But, only a few
people have HMs!


Aww,
bummer!


Teach POKéMON
moves of the same
element type for
more power.


Have you taught
your bird POKéMON
how to FLY?


Shot
down in flames!


Bird POKéMON are
my true love!


Have you heard of
the legendary
POKéMON?


Why?
Why'd I lose?


The 3 legendary
POKéMON are all
birds of prey.


I'm not into it,
but OK! Let's go!


I
knew it!


Winning, losing,
it doesn't matter
in the long run!


C'mon, c'mon.
Let's go, let's
go, let's go!


Arrg!
Lost! Get lost!


What, what, what?
What do you want?


Perfect! I need to
burn some time!


What?
You!?


Raising POKéMON
is a drag, man.


We ride out here
because there's
more room!


Wipe out!


It's cool you
made your POKéMON
so strong!

Might is right!
And you know it!


POKéMON fight?
Cool! Rumble!


Blown
away!


You know who'd
win, you and me
one on one!


ROUTE 14
West to FUCHSIA
CITY


Let me try out the
POKéMON I just
got in a trade!


Not
good enough!


You can't change
the nickname of
any POKéMON you
get in a trade.

Only the Original
Trainer can.


You look gentle,
so I think I can
beat you!


No,
wrong!


I'm afraid of
BIKERs, they look
so ugly and mean!


When I whistle, I
can summon bird
POKéMON!


Ow!
That's tragic!


Maybe I'm not cut
out for battles.


Hmm? My birds are
shivering! You're
good, aren't you?


Just
as I thought!


Did you know moves
like EARTHQUAKE
don't have any
effect on birds?


Oh, you're a
little cutie!


You looked
so cute too!


I forgive you!
I can take it!


I raise POKéMON
because I live
alone!


I didn't
ask for this!


I just like going
home to be with
my POKéMON!


Hey kid! C'mon!
I just got these!


Why
not?


You only live
once, so I live
as an outlaw!
TEAM ROCKET RULES!


Fork over all your
cash when you
lose to me, kid!


That
can't be true!


I was just joking
about the money!


What's cool?
Trading POKéMON!


I
said trade!


I trade POKéMON
with my friends!


Want to play with
my POKéMON?


I was
too impatient!


I'll go train with
weaker people.


ROUTE 15
West to FUCHSIA
CITY


What do you want?


Don't you
dare laugh!


We like just
hanging here,
what's it to you?


Nice BIKE!
Hand it over!


Knock-
out!


Forget it, who
needs your BIKE!


Come out and play,
little mouse!


You
little rat!


I hate losing!
Get away from me!


Hey, you just
bumped me!


Kaboom!


You can also get
to FUCHSIA from
VERMILION using a
coastal road.


I'm feeling
hungry and mean!


Bad,
bad, bad!


I like my POKéMON
ferocious! They
tear up enemies!


Sure, I'll go!


Don't make
me mad!


I like harassing
people with my
vicious POKéMON!


A sleeping POKéMON
blocks the way!


SNORLAX woke up!

It attacked in a
grumpy rage!


With a big yawn,
SNORLAX returned
to the mountains!


Enjoy the slope!

I love racing

Are you looking

Let VOLTORB

Grounded

I got my VOLTORB
at the abandoned

My POKéMON won't
evolve! Why?


Why,
you!


Maybe some POKéMON
need element
STONEs to evolve.


I need a little
exercise!


Whew!
Good workout!


I'm sure I lost
weight there!


Be a rebel!


Aaaargh!


Be ready to fight
for your beliefs!


Nice BIKE!
How's it handle?


Shoot!


The slope makes
it hard to steer!


Get lost, kid!
I'm bushed!


Are you

I need to catch

It's a notice!

Watch out for

I always check

Tch!


I wish I had a

I also collect sea

Wait! You'll have
a heart attack!


Ooh!
That's chilly!


Watch out for
TENTACOOL!


I love swimming!
What about you?


Belly
flop!


I can beat POKéMON
at swimming!


What's beyond the
horizon?


Glub!


I see a couple of
islands!


I tried diving
for POKéMON, but
it was a no go!


Help!


You have to fish
for sea POKéMON!


I look at the
sea to forget!


Ooh!
Traumatic!


I'm looking at the
sea to forget!


Oh, I just love
your ride! Can I
have it if I win?


Oh!
I lost!


It's still a long
way to go to
SEAFOAM ISLANDS.


Swimming's great!
Sunburns aren't!


Shocker!


My boy friend
wanted to swim to
SEAFOAM ISLANDS.


These waters are
treacherous!


Ooh!
Dangerous!


I got a cramp!
Glub, glub...


I swam here, but
I'm tired.


I'm
exhausted...


LAPRAS is so big,
it must keep you
dry on water.

SEAFOAM ISLANDS


The water is
shallow here.


Splash!


I wish I could
ride my POKéMON.


SEAFOAM is a
quiet getaway!


Quit it!


There's a huge
cavern underneath
this island.


I love floating
with the fishes!


Yowch!


Want to float
with me?


Are you on
vacation too?


No
mercy at all!


SEAFOAM used to
be one island!


Check out my buff
physique!


Wimpy!


I should've been
buffing up my
POKéMON, not me!


Why are you
riding a POKéMON?
Can't you swim?


Ouch!
Torpedoed!


Riding a POKéMON
sure looks fun!


I rode my bird
POKéMON here!


Oh
no!


My birds can't
FLY me back!


My boy friend gave
me big pearls!


Don't
touch my pearls!


Will my pearls
grow bigger
inside CLOYSTER?


I swam here from
CINNABAR ISLAND!


I'm
so disappointed!


POKéMON have
taken over an
abandoned mansion
on CINNABAR!


CINNABAR, in the
west, has a LAB
for POKéMON.


Wait!


CINNABAR is a 
volcanic island!


SEAFOAM ISLANDS


You want to know
if the fish are
biting?


Dang!


I can't catch
anything good!


I got a big haul!
Wanna go for it?


Darn
MAGIKARP!


I seem to only
catch MAGIKARP!


The sea cleanses
my body and soul!


Ayah!


I like the
mountains too!


What's wrong with
me swimming?


Cheap
shot!


I look like what?
A studded inner
tube? Get lost!


I caught all my
POKéMON at sea!


Diver!!
Down!!


Where'd you catch
your POKéMON?


Right now, I'm in
a triathlon meet!


Pant...
pant...pant...


I'm beat!
But, I still have
the bike race and
marathon left!


Ahh! Feel the sun
and the wind!


Yow!
I lost!


I'm sunburnt to a
crisp!


Hey, don't scare
away the fish!


Sorry!
I didn't mean it!


I was just angry
that I couldn't
catch anything.


Keep me company
'til I get a hit!


That
burned some time.


Oh wait! I got a
bite! Yeah!


Awww!
You just lucked
out!


SONY: What?
Why do I have 2
POKéMON?

You should catch
some more too!


What!?

I was just
careless!


SONY: Hahaha!
NINTEN! That's
your best? You're
nowhere near as
good as me, pal!

Go train some
more! You loser!


SONY: Hey!
NINTEN!

You're going to
POKéMON LEAGUE?

Forget it! You
probably don't
have any BADGEs!

The guard won't
let you through!

By the way, did
your POKéMON
get any stronger?


I heard POKéMON
LEAGUE has many
tough trainers!

I have to figure
out how to get
past them!

You should quit
dawdling and get
a move on!


SONY: What?
NINTEN! What a
surprise to see
you here!

So you're going to
POKéMON LEAGUE?

You collected all
the BADGEs too?
That's cool!

Then I'll whip
you, NINTEN, as
a warmup for
POKéMON LEAGUE!

Come on!


That loosened me
up! I'm ready for
POKéMON LEAGUE!

NINTEN, you need
more practice!

But hey, you know
that! I'm out of

You just earned a

You don't have

By the way, would
you like to join
TEAM ROCKET?

We're a group
dedicated to evil
using POKéMON!

Want to join?

Are you sure?

Come on, join us!

I'm telling you
to join!

OK, you need
convincing!

I'll make you an
offer you can't
refuse!


Arrgh!
You are good!


With your ability,
you could become
a top leader in
TEAM ROCKET!


I saw your feat
from the grass!


I
thought not!


I hid because the
people on the
bridge scared me!


OK! I'm No. 5!
I'll stomp you!


Whoa!
Too much!


I did my best, I
have no regrets!


I'm No. 4!
Getting tired?


I lost
too!


I did my best, so
I've no regrets!


Here's No. 3!
I won't be easy!


Ow!
Stomped flat!


I did my best, I
have no regrets!


I'm second!
Now it's serious!


How could I
lose?


I did my best, I
have no regrets!


This is NUGGET
BRIDGE! Beat us 5
trainers and win
a fabulous prize!

Think you got
what it takes?


Whoo!
Good stuff!


I did my best, I
have no regrets!


I'm not good at
raising POKéMON.

I should release
my CHARMANDER
because I haven't
raised it well...

If you promise me
you'll care for
it, it's yours.


Take good care of
my CHARMANDER!


Oh... I'd better
release it then.


How's CHARMANDER
doing?


Local trainers
come here to
practice!


You're
decent.


All POKéMON have
weaknesses. It's
best to raise
different kinds.


Dad took me to a
great party on
S.S.ANNE at
VERMILION CITY!


I'm
not mad!


On S.S.ANNE, I
saw trainers from
around the world.


I'm a cool guy.
I've got a girl
friend!


Aww,
darn...


Oh well. My girl
will cheer me up.


Hi! My boy
friend is cool!


I'm in
a slump!


I wish my guy was
as good as you!


I knew I had to
fight you!


I knew
I'd lose too!


If your POKéMON
gets confused or
falls asleep,
switch it!


My friend has a
cute POKéMON.
I'm so jealous!


I'm
not so jealous!


You came from MT.
MOON? May I have
a CLEFAIRY?


I just got down
from MT.MOON,
but I'm ready!


You
worked hard!


Drat!
A ZUBAT bit me
back in there.


I'm off to see a
POKéMON collector
at the cape!


You
got me.


The collector has
many rare kinds
of POKéMON.


You're going to
see BILL? First,
let's fight!


You're
something.


The trail below

BILL lives here!


The file data is
destroyed!


Would you like to
SAVE the game?


Saving...


NINTEN saved
the game!


The older file
will be erased to
save. Okay?


When you change a
POKéMON BOX, data
will be saved.

Is that okay?


Choose a

MOM: Right.
All boys leave
home someday.
It said so on TV.

PROF.OAK, next
door, is looking
for you.


MOM: NINTEN, if
you drive your
POKéMON too hard,
they'll dislike
you.

You should take a
rest.


MOM: Oh good!
You and your
POKéMON are
looking great!
Take care now!


There's a movie
on TV. Four boys
are walking on
railroad tracks.

I better go too.


Oops, wrong side.


Hi NINTEN!
SONY is out at
Grandpa's lab.


Grandpa asked you
to run an errand?
Here, this will
help you!


NINTEN got a
{1.CF4A}!


You have too much
stuff with you.


Use the TOWN MAP
to find out where
you are.


Spending time
with your POKéMON
makes them more
friendly to you.


It's a big map!
This is useful!


SONY: Yo
NINTEN! Gramps
isn't around!

I ran here 'cos
he said he had a
POKéMON for me.


SONY: Humph!
I'll get a better
POKéMON than you!


SONY: Heh, my
POKéMON looks a
lot stronger.


That's a POKé
BALL. There's a
POKéMON inside!


OAK: Go ahead,
it's yours!


OAK: If a wild
POKéMON appears,
your POKéMON can
fight against it!

Afterward, go on
to the next town.


OAK: You should
talk to it and
see how it feels.


OAK: Oh, NINTEN!

How is my old
POKéMON?

Well, it seems to
like you a lot.

You must be
talented as a
POKéMON trainer!

What? You have
something for me?

NINTEN delivered
OAK's PARCEL.




Ah! This is the
custom POKé BALL
I ordered!
Thanks, NINTEN!

By the way, I must
ask you to do
something for me.


POKéMON around the
world wait for
you, NINTEN!


OAK: You can't get
detailed data on
POKéMON by just
seeing them.

You must catch
them! Use these
to capture wild
POKéMON.

NINTEN got 5
POKé BALLs!




When a wild
POKéMON appears,
it's fair game.

Just like I showed
you, throw a POKé
BALL at it and try
to catch it!

This won't always
work, though.

A healthy POKéMON
could escape. You
have to be lucky!


OAK: Come see me
sometimes.

I want to know how
your POKéDEX is
coming along.


OAK: Good to see 
you! How is your 
POKéDEX coming? 
Here, let me take
a look!


It's encyclopedia-
like, but the
pages are blank!


?


PROF.OAK is the
authority on
POKéMON!

Many POKéMON
trainers hold him
in high regard!


SONY: Gramps!
I'm fed up with
waiting!


OAK: Hmm? SONY?
Why are you here
already?

I said for you to
come by later...

Ah, whatever!
Just wait there.

Look, NINTEN! Do
you see that ball
on the table?

It's called a POKé
BALL. It holds a
POKéMON inside.

You may have it!
Go on, take it!


SONY: Hey!
Gramps! What
about me?


OAK: Be patient,
SONY, I'll give
you one later.


SONY: No way!
NINTEN, I want
this POKéMON!


SONY snatched
the POKéMON!


OAK: SONY! What
are you doing?


SONY: Gramps, I
want this one!


OAK: But, I... Oh,
all right then.
That POKéMON is
yours.

I was going to
give you one
anyway...

NINTEN, come over
here.


OAK: NINTEN, this
is the POKéMON I
caught earlier.

You can have it.
I caught it in
the wild and it's
not tame yet.


NINTEN received
a {1.CD6D}!


OAK: Hey! Don't go
away yet!


SONY: Wait
NINTEN!
Let's check out
our POKéMON!

Come on, I'll take
you on!


WHAT?
Unbelievable!
I picked the
wrong POKéMON!


SONY: Yeah! Am
I great or what?


SONY: Okay!
I'll make my
POKéMON fight to
toughen it up!

NINTEN! Gramps!
Smell you later!


OAK: What?


OAK: Would you
look at that!

It's odd, but it
appears that your
PIKACHU dislikes
POKé BALLs.

You should just
keep it with you.

That should make
it happy!

You can talk to it
and see how it
feels about you.


SONY: Gramps!


SONY: Gramps,
my POKéMON has
grown stronger!
Check it out!


OAK: Ah, SONY,
good timing!

I needed to ask
both of you to do
something for me.


On the desk there
is my invention,
POKéDEX!

It automatically
records data on
POKéMON you've
seen or caught!

It's a hi-tech
encyclopedia!


OAK: NINTEN and
SONY! Take
these with you!

NINTEN got
POKéDEX from OAK!


To make a complete
guide on all the
POKéMON in the
world...

That was my dream!

But, I'm too old!
I can't do it!

So, I want you two
to fulfill my
dream for me!

Get moving, you
two!

This is a great
undertaking in
POKéMON history!


SONY: Alright
Gramps! Leave it
all to me!

NINTEN, I hate to
say it, but I
don't need you!

I know! I'll
borrow a TOWN MAP
from my sis!

I'll tell her not
to lend you one,
NINTEN! Hahaha!


I study POKéMON as
PROF.OAK's AIDE.


POKéDEX comp-
letion is:

{9.FFDB.13} POKéMON seen
{9.FFDC.13} POKéMON owned

PROF.OAK's
Rating:


You still have
lots to do.
Look for POKéMON
in grassy areas!


You're on the
right track! 
Get a FLASH HM
from my AIDE!


You still need
more POKéMON!
Try to catch
other species!


Good, you're
trying hard!
Get an ITEMFINDER
from my AIDE!


Looking good!
Go find my AIDE
when you get 50!


You finally got at
least 50 species!
Be sure to get
EXP.ALL from my
AIDE!


Oh! This is get-
ting even better!


Very good!
Go fish for some
marine POKéMON!


Wonderful!
Do you like to
collect things?


I'm impressed!
It must have been
difficult to do!


You finally got at
least 100 species!
I can't believe
how good you are!


You even have the
evolved forms of
POKéMON! Super!


Excellent! Trade
with friends to
get some more!


Outstanding!
You've become a
real pro at this!


I have nothing
left to say!
You're the
authority now!


Your POKéDEX is
fully complete!
Congratulations!


You can use that
PC in the corner.

The receptionist
told me. So kind!


There's a POKéMON
CENTER in every
town ahead.

They don't charge
any money either!


Okay! Say hi to
PROF.OAK for me!


Hey! You came from
PALLET TOWN?


You know PROF.
OAK, right?

His order came in.
Will you take it
to him?

NINTEN got
OAK's PARCEL!


This shop sells a
lot of PARLYZ
HEALs.


The shop finally
has some POTIONs
in stock.


Whew! I'm trying
to memorize all
my notes.


Sis says POKéMON
will become tame
if you treat them
nicely.


Okay!

Be sure to read
the blackboard
carefully!


Coming up with
nicknames is fun,
but hard.

Simple names are
the easiest to
remember.


My Daddy loves
POKéMON too.


SPEARY: Tetweet!


SPEAROW
Name: SPEARY


Fwahahaha! This is
my hideout!

I planned to
resurrect TEAM
ROCKET here!

But, you have
caught me again!
So be it! This
time, I'm not
holding back!

Once more, you
shall face
GIOVANNI, the
greatest trainer!


Ha!
That was a truly
intense fight!
You have won!
As proof, here is
the EARTHBADGE!


Having lost, I
cannot face my
underlings!
TEAM ROCKET is
finished forever!

I will dedicate my
life to the study
of POKéMON!

Let us meet again
someday!
Farewell!


The EARTHBADGE
makes POKéMON of
any level obey!

It is evidence of
your mastery as a
POKéMON trainer!

With it, you can
enter the POKéMON
LEAGUE!

It is my gift for
your POKéMON
LEAGUE challenge!


NINTEN received
TM27!




TM27 is FISSURE!
It will take out
POKéMON with just
one hit!

I made it when I
ran the GYM here,
too long ago...


You do not have
space for this!


Heh! You must be
running out of
steam by now!


I
ran out of gas!


You need power to
keep up with our
GYM LEADER!


Rrrroar! I'm
working myself
into a rage!


Wargh!


I'm still not
worthy!


POKéMON and I, we
make wonderful
music together!


You are in
perfect harmony!


Do you know the
identity of our
GYM LEADER?


Karate is the
ultimate form of
martial arts!


Atcho!


If my POKéMON
were as good at
Karate as I...


The truly talented
win with style!


I
lost my grip!


The LEADER will
scold me!


I'm the KARATE
KING! Your fate
rests with me!


Ayah!


POKéMON LEAGUE?
You? Don't get
cocky!


Your POKéMON will
cower at the
crack of my whip!


Yowch!
Whiplash!


Wait! I was just
careless!


VIRIDIAN GYM was
closed for a long
time, but now our
LEADER is back!


I
was beaten?


You can go on to
POKéMON LEAGUE
only by defeating
our GYM LEADER!


Yo! Champ in
making!

Even I don't know
VIRIDIAN LEADER's
identity!

This will be the
toughest of all
the GYM LEADERs!

I heard that the
trainers here
like ground-type
POKéMON!


Blow me away!
GIOVANNI was the
GYM LEADER here?


Come again!


It's ¥50 for a
child's ticket.

Would you like to
come in?


Right, ¥50!
Thank you!


You don't have
enough money.


You can't sneak
in the back way!

Oh, whatever!
Do you know what
AMBER is?


There's a lab
somewhere trying
to resurrect
ancient POKéMON
from AMBER.


AMBER is fossil-
ized tree sap.


Please go to the
other side!


Take plenty of
time to look!


That is one
magnificent
fossil!


Ssh! I think that
this chunk of
AMBER contains
POKéMON DNA!

It would be great
if POKéMON could
be resurrected
from it!

But, my colleagues
just ignore me!

So, I have a favor
to ask!

Take this to a
POKéMON LAB and
get it examined!


NINTEN received
OLD AMBER!


Ssh! Get the OLD
AMBER checked!


You don't have
space for this!


We are proud of 2
fossils of very
rare, prehistoric
POKéMON!


The AMBER is
clear and gold!


MOON STONE?

What's so special
about it?


July 20, 1969!

The 1st lunar
landing!

I bought a color
TV to watch it!


We have a space
exhibit now.


I want a PIKACHU!
It's so cute!

I asked my Daddy
to catch me one!


Yeah, a PIKACHU
soon, I promise!


Your PIKACHU looks
untamed.
May I have it for
my daughter?


I'd like to get
that PIKACHU off
you, but it's too
attached to you.


SPACE SHUTTLE
COLUMBIA


Meteorite that
fell on MT.MOON.
}MOON STONE?}


I'm BROCK!
I'm PEWTER's GYM
LEADER!

I believe in rock
hard defense and
determination!

That's why my
POKéMON are all
the rock-type!

Do you still want
to challenge me?
Fine then! Show
me your best!


There are all
kinds of trainers
in the world!

Some raise POKéMON
for fights. Some
see them as pets.

I'm in training to
become a POKéMON
breeder.

If you take your
POKéMON training
seriously, go
visit the GYM in
CERULEAN and test
your abilities!


Wait! Take this
with you!


NINTEN received
TM34!




A TM contains a
technique that
can be taught to
POKéMON!

A TM is good only
once! So when you
use one to teach
a new technique,
pick the POKéMON
carefully!

TM34 contains
BIDE!

Your POKéMON will
absorb damage in
battle then pay
it back double!


You don't have
room for this!


I took
you for granted.

As proof of your
victory, here's
the BOULDERBADGE!

NINTEN received
the BOULDERBADGE!




That's an official
POKéMON LEAGUE
BADGE!

Its bearer's
POKéMON become
more powerful!

The technique
FLASH can now be
used anytime!


Stop right there,
kid!

You're still light
years from facing
BROCK!


Darn!

Light years isn't
time! It measures
distance!


You're pretty hot,
but not as hot
as BROCK!


Hiya! I can tell
you have what it
takes to become a
POKéMON champ!

I'm no trainer,
but I can tell
you how to win!

Let me take you
to the top!


All right! Let's
get happening!


The 1st POKéMON
out in a match is
at the top of the
POKéMON LIST!

By changing the
order of POKéMON,
matches could be
made easier!


It's a free
service! Let's
get happening!


Just as I thought!
You're POKéMON
champ material!


All right! Let's
get happening!

It will be tough
for your PIKACHU
at this GYM!

Electric attacks
are harmless to
BROCK's ground-
type POKéMON.


NIDORAN: Bowbow!


NIDORAN sit!


Our POKéMON's an
outsider, so it's
hard to handle.

An outsider is a
POKéMON that you
get in a trade.

It grows fast, but
it may ignore an
unskilled trainer
in battle!

If only we had
some BADGEs...


A shady old man
got me to buy
this really weird
fish POKéMON!

It's totally weak
and it cost ¥500!


Good things can
happen if you
raise POKéMON
diligently, even
the weak ones!


POKéMON learn new
techniques as
they grow!

But, some moves
must be taught by
the trainer!


POKéMON become
easier to catch
when they are
hurt or asleep!

But, it's not a
sure thing!


What!?

TEAM ROCKET is
at MT.MOON? Huh?
I'm on the phone!

Scram!


POKéMON CENTERS
are wonderful!

They heal POKéMON
completely.

Even conditions
like sleep, burn,
poison and others
are cured.


JIGGLYPUFF: Puu
pupuu!


Those miserable
ROCKETs!

Look what they
did here!

They stole a TM
for teaching
POKéMON how to
DIG holes!

That cost me a
bundle, it did!


I figure what's
lost is lost!

I decided to teach
DIGLETT how to
DIG without a TM!


TEAM ROCKET must
be trying to DIG
their way into no
good!


TEAM ROCKET left
a way out!


I take care of
injured POKéMON.

I nursed this
BULBASAUR back to
health.

It needs a good
trainer to take
care of it now.


I know! Would you
take care of this
BULBASAUR?


Please take care
of BULBASAUR!


Is BULBASAUR
doing well?


Oh...
That's too bad...


BULBASAUR: Bubba!
Zoar!


ODDISH: Orddissh!


SANDSHREW: Pikii!


That BILL!

I heard that
he'll do whatever
it takes to get
rare POKéMON!


Have you heard
about BILL?

Everyone calls
him a POKéMANIAC!

I think people
are just jealous
of BILL, though.

Who wouldn't want
to boast about
their POKéMON?


Hi, you're a new
face!

What's your policy
on POKéMON? What
is your approach?

My policy is an
all-out offensive
with water-type
POKéMON!

MISTY, the world-
famous beauty, is
your host!

Are you ready,
sweetie?


TM11 teaches
BUBBLEBEAM!

Use it on an
aquatic POKéMON!


The CASCADEBADGE
makes all POKéMON
up to L30 obey!

That includes
even outsiders!

There's more, you
can now use CUT
anytime!

You can CUT down
small bushes to
open new paths!

You can also have
my favorite TM!


NINTEN received
TM11!


You better make
room for this!


I can't
believe I lost!

All right!

You can have the
CASCADEBADGE to
show you beat me!


I'm more than good
enough for you!

MISTY can wait!


You
overwhelmed me!


You have to face
other trainers to
find out how good
you really are.


Splash!

I'm first up!
Let's do it!


That
can't be!


MISTY is going to
keep improving!

She won't lose to
someone like you!


Yo! Champ in
making!

Here's my advice!

The LEADER, MISTY,
is a pro who uses
water POKéMON!

You can drain all
their water with
plant POKéMON!

Or, zap them with
electricity!


You beat MISTY!
What'd I tell ya?

You and me, kid,
we make a pretty
darn good team!


Hi! Welcome to
our BIKE SHOP.

Have we got just
the BIKE for you!


It's a cool BIKE!
Do you want it?


Sorry! You can't
afford it!


Oh, that's...

A BIKE VOUCHER!

OK! Here you go!


NINTEN exchanged
the BIKE VOUCHER
for a BICYCLE.


Come back again
sometime!


How do you like
your new BICYCLE?

You can take it
on CYCLING ROAD
and in caves!


You better make
room for this!


A plain city BIKE
is good enough
for me!

You can't put a
shopping basket
on an MTB!


These BIKEs are
cool, but they're
way expensive!


Wow. Your BIKE is
really cool!


Use REPEL to keep
bugs and weak
POKéMON away.

Put your strongest
POKéMON at the
top of the list
for best results!


Have you seen any
RARE CANDY?

It's supposed to
make POKéMON go
up one level!


POKéMON BADGEs
are owned only by
skilled trainers.

I see you have
at least one.

Those BADGEs have
amazing secrets!


Now then...

Which of the 8
BADGEs should I
describe?


Come visit me any-
time you wish.


The ATTACK of all
POKéMON increases
a little bit.

It also lets you
use FLASH any-
time you desire.


POKéMON up to L30
will obey you.

Any higher, they
become unruly!

It also lets you
use CUT outside
of battle.


The SPEED of all
POKéMON increases
a little bit.

It also lets you
use FLY outside
of battle.


POKéMON up to L50
will obey you.

Any higher, they
become unruly!

It also lets you
use STRENGTH out-
side of battle.



The DEFENSE of all
POKéMON increases
a little bit.

It also lets you
use SURF outside
of battle.


POKéMON up to L70
will obey you.

Any higher, they
become unruly!


Your POKéMON's
SPECIAL abilities
increase a bit.


All POKéMON will
obey you!


TEAM ROCKET will
do anything for
the sake of gold!


I saw CUBONE's
mother die trying
to escape from
TEAM ROCKET!


POKéMON TOWER was
erected in the
memory of POKéMON
that had died.


Did you come to
pay respects?
Bless you!


I came to pray
for my CLEFAIRY.

Sniff! I can't
stop crying...


My GROWLITHE...
Why did you die?


I am a CHANNELER!
There are spirits
up to mischief!


SONY: Hey,
NINTEN! What
brings you here?
Your POKéMON
don't look dead!

I can at least
make them faint!
Let's go, pal!


What?
You stinker!

I took it easy on
you too!


SONY: Well,
look at all your
wimpy POKéMON!

Toughen them up a
bit more!


How's your POKéDEX
coming, pal?
I just caught a
CUBONE!

I can't find the
grown-up MAROWAK
yet!

I doubt there are
any left! Well, I
better get going!
I've got a lot to
accomplish, pal!

Smell ya later!


Even we could not
identify the
wayward GHOSTs!

A SILPH SCOPE
might be able to
unmask them.


Urrg...Awaa...
Huhu...graa..


Hwa!
I'm saved!


The GHOSTs can be
identified by the
SILPH SCOPE.


Kekeke....
Kwaaah!


Hmm?
What am I doing?


Sorry! I was
possessed!


Be gone!
Evil spirit!


Whew!
The spirit left!


My friends were
possessed too!


GHOST! No!
Kwaaah!


Where
is the GHOST?


I must have been
dreaming...


Be cursed with
me! Kwaaah!


What!


We can't crack
the identity of
the GHOSTs.


Huhuhu...
Beat me not!


Huh?
Who? What?


May the departed
souls of POKéMON
rest in peace...


Come, child! I
sealed this space
with white magic!

You can rest here!


Give...me...
your...soul...


Gasp!


I was under
possession!


You...shall...
join...us...


What
a nightmare!


I was possessed!


Zombies!


Ha?


I regained my
senses!


Urgah...
Urff....


Whoo!


I fell to evil
spirits despite
my training!


Entered purified,
protected zone!

NINTEN's POKéMON
are fully healed!


The GHOST was the
restless soul of
CUBONE's mother!


The mother's soul
was calmed.

It departed to
the afterlife!


Give...me...
blood...


Groan!


I feel anemic and
weak...


Urff... Kwaah!


Some-
thing fell out!


Hair didn't fall
out! It was an
evil spirit!


Ke..ke...ke...
ke..ke...ke!!


Keee!


What's going on
here?


Be gone...
Intruders...


Stop right there!


Grampa here wanted
to complain, so
we're setting him
straight.

So render yourself
invisible, or
prepare to fight!


You
will regret this!


Looks like TEAM
ROCKET's blasting
off again!


MR.FUJI: Heh? You
came to save me?

Thank you. But, I
came here of my
own free will.

I came to calm
the soul of
CUBONE's mother.

I think MAROWAK's
spirit has gone
to the afterlife.

I must thank you
for your kind
concern!

Follow me to my
home, POKéMON
HOUSE at the foot
of this tower.


That's odd, MR.FUJI
isn't here.
Where'd he go?


MR.FUJI had been
praying alone for
CUBONE's mother.


This is really
MR.FUJI's house.

He's really kind!

He looks after
abandoned and
orphaned POKéMON!


It's so warm!
POKéMON are so
nice to hug!


PSYDUCK: Gwappa!


NIDORINO: Gaoo!


MR.FUJI: NINTEN.

Your POKéDEX quest
may fail without
love for your
POKéMON.

I think this may
help your quest.


NINTEN received
a {1.CF4A}!




Upon hearing POKé
FLUTE, sleeping
POKéMON will
spring awake.

It works on all
sleeping POKéMON.


You must make
room for this!


MR.FUJI: Has my
FLUTE helped you?


POKéMON Monthly
Grand Prize
Drawing!

The application
form is...

Gone! It's been
clipped out!


I'm searching for
items that raise
the abilities of
POKéMON during a
single battle.

X ATTACK, X
DEFEND, X SPEED
and X SPECIAL are
what I'm after.

Do you know where
I can get them?


You know REVIVE?
It revives any
fainted POKéMON!


I found a NUGGET
in the mountains.

I thought it was
useless, but it
sold for ¥5000!


CUBONE: Kyarugoo!


I hate those
horrible ROCKETs!

That poor CUBONE's
mother...

It was killed
trying to escape
from TEAM ROCKET!


The GHOST of
POKéMON TOWER is
gone!

Someone must have
soothed its
restless soul!


Hello, hello!
I am the official
NAME RATER!

Want me to rate
the nicknames of
your POKéMON?


Which POKéMON
should I look at?


{1.CD6D}, is it?
That is a decent
nickname!

But, would you
like me to give
it a nicer name?

How about it?


Fine! What should
we name it?


OK! This POKéMON
has been renamed
{1.CEE9}!

That's a better
name than before!


Fine! Come any-
time you like!


{1.CD6D}, is it?
That is a truly
impeccable name!

Take good care of
{1.CD6D}!


Even if they are
the same level,
POKéMON can have
very different
abilities.

A POKéMON raised
by a trainer is
stronger than one
in the wild.


My POKéMON was
poisoned! It
fainted while we
were walking!


Won't you admire
my CLEFAIRY's
adorable tail?


Humph! My CLEFAIRY
is twice as cute
as that one!


Our CHAIRMAN's new
hobby is taking
POKéMON photos.

He gave me a nice
PRINT of my cute
CLEFAIRY.


I just love my
SEEL!

It squeals when I
hug it!


Oh dear!

My SEEL is far
more attractive!


I'm going to hook
up the cable to
get a photo PRINT
of my SEEL!


CLEFAIRY: Pippii!


SEEL: Kyuoo!


I chair the
POKéMON Fan Club!

I have more than
100 POKéMON. I
love them all!

I'm very fussy
when it comes to
POKéMON!

So...

Did you come to
hear me brag
about my POKéMON?


Good!
Then listen up!

My favorite
RAPIDASH...

It...cute...
lovely...smart...
plus...amazing...
you think so?...
oh yes...it...
stunning...
kindly...
love it!

Hug it...when...
sleeping...warm
and cuddly...
spectacular...
ravishing...
...Oops! Look at
the time! I kept
you too long!

Thanks for hearing
me out! I want
you to have this!


NINTEN received
a {1.CF4A}!




Exchange that for
a BICYCLE!

Don't worry, my
FEAROW will FLY
me anywhere!

So, I don't need a
BICYCLE!

I hope you like
cycling!


Oh. Come back
when you want to
hear my story!


Hello, NINTEN!

Did you come see
me about my
POKéMON again?

No? Too bad!


Make room for
this!


Hi there, NINTEN!
Have you seen my
POKéMON photos?

I have them framed
up on that wall.

Ah, I know!

Would you like me
to take a photo
of your POKéMON?


No? That's really
disappointing.


OK, I'm done.


Maybe we won't
PRINT this now.


Our CHAIRMAN is
very vocal about
POKéMON.


There are evil
people who will
use POKéMON for
criminal acts.

TEAM ROCKET
traffics in rare
POKéMON.

They also abandon
POKéMON that they
consider not to
be popular or
useful.


I think POKéMON
can be good or
evil. It depends
on the trainer.


Ten-hut! Welcome
to VERMILION GYM!

Will you look at
that, a pint-size
challenger!

Hahaha! You've got
big and brassy
nerves to take me
on with your puny
power!

A POKéMON battle
is war! I'll show
you, civilian!

I'll shock you
into surrender!


A little word of
advice, kid!

Electricity is
sure powerful!

But, it's useless
against ground-
type POKéMON!


The THUNDERBADGE
cranks up your
POKéMON's SPEED!

It also lets your
POKéMON FLY any-
time, kid!

You're special,
kid! Take this!


NINTEN received 
{1.CF4A}!




TM24 contains
THUNDERBOLT!

Teach it to an
electric POKéMON!


Yo kid, make room
in your pack!


Whoa!

You're the real
deal, kid!

Fine then, take
the THUNDERBADGE!


When I was in the
Army, LT.SURGE
was my strict CO!


Stop!
You're very good!


The door won't
open?

LT.SURGE always
was cautious!


I'm a lightweight,
but I'm good with
electricity!


Fried!


OK, I'll talk!

LT.SURGE said he
hid door switches
inside something!


This is no place
for kids!


Wow!
Surprised me!


LT.SURGE set up
double locks!
Here's a hint!

When you open the
1st lock, the 2nd
lock is right
next to it!


Yo! Champ in
making!

LT.SURGE has a
nickname. People
refer to him as
the Lightning
American!

He's an expert on
electric POKéMON!

Birds and water
POKéMON are at
risk! Beware of
paralysis too!

LT.SURGE is very
cautious!

You'll have to
break a code to
get to him!


Whew! That match
was electric!


I'm getting my
PIDGEY to fly a
letter to SAFFRON
in the north!


PIDGEY: Kurukkoo!


Dear PIPPI, I hope
to see you soon.

I heard SAFFRON
has problems with
TEAM ROCKET.

VERMILION appears
to be safe.





Once a POKéMON
learns an HM, the
technique can't
be replaced.

Better think care-
fully before you
teach HM moves.


I'm the FISHING
GURU!

I simply Looove
fishing!

Do you like to
fish?


Grand! I like
your style!

Take this and
fish, young one!

Why don't you
take more care
with PIKACHU?


You must be happy
to have a POKéMON
that cute.


Your PIKACHU seems
tamed.


Your PIKACHU looks
happy with you.


You look like a
fantastic duo.

You're making me
jealous!

Me? I'm the

What a surprise!
I never expected
anyone to fill a
POKéDEX.


I'm the graphic

I drew you!


I'm the graphic
artist!

Wow, you finished
your POKéDEX!
Want me to PRINT
out a DIPLOMA
as proof?


Just tell me if
you want to PRINT
out a DIPLOMA.


All done!


OK, let's not
PRINT.


I wrote the story!
Isn't ERIKA cute?

I like MISTY a
lot too!

Oh, and SABRINA,
I like her!


I wrote the story!

It's great you
caught all the
POKéMON! Thanks!


Is that right?

I'm the game
designer!

Filling up your
POKéDEX is tough,
but don't quit!

When you finish,
come tell me!


Wow! Excellent!
You completed
your POKéDEX!
Congratulations!
...


Go show off your
DIPLOMA to
the development
crew.


It's the game

with it could bug
out the game!


Someone's playing

POKé FLUTE awakens
POKéMON with a
sound that only
they can hear!


I rode uphill on
CYCLING ROAD from
FUCHSIA!


Hello. Lovely
weather isn't it?
It's so pleasant.

...Oh dear...
I must have dozed
off. Welcome.

My name is ERIKA.
I am the LEADER
of CELADON GYM.

I teach the art of
flower arranging.
My POKéMON are of
the grass-type.

Oh, I'm sorry, I
had no idea that
you wished to
challenge me.

Very well, but I
shall not lose.


Oh!
I concede defeat.

You are remarkably
strong.

I must confer you
the RAINBOWBADGE.


You are cataloging
POKéMON? I must
say I'm impressed.

I would never
collect POKéMON
if they were
unattractive.


The RAINBOWBADGE
will make POKéMON
up to L50 obey.

It also allows
POKéMON to use
STRENGTH in and
out of battle.

Please also take
this with you.


NINTEN received

TM21 contains
MEGA DRAIN.

Half the damage
it inflicts is
drained to heal
your POKéMON!


You should make
room for this.


Hey!

You are not
allowed in here!


You're
too rough!


Bleaah!
I hope ERIKA
wipes you out!


I was getting
bored.


My
makeup!


Grass-type POKéMON
are tough against
the water-type!

They also have an
edge on rock and
ground POKéMON!


Aren't you the
peeping Tom?


I'm
in shock!


Oh, you weren't
peeping? We get a
lot of gawkers!


Look at my grass
POKéMON!

They're so easy
to raise!


No!


We only use grass-
type POKéMON at
our GYM!

We also use them
for making flower
arrangements!


Don't bring any
bugs or fire
POKéMON in here!


Oh!
You!


Our LEADER, ERIKA,
might be quiet,
but she's also
very skilled!


Pleased to meet
you. My hobby is
POKéMON training.


Oh!
Splendid!


I have a blind
date coming up.
I have to learn
to be polite.


Welcome to
CELADON GYM!

You better not
underestimate
girl power!


Oh!
Beaten!


I didn't bring my
best POKéMON!

Wait 'til next
time!


Welcome!

You can exchange
your coins for
fabulous prizes
next door.


Welcome to ROCKET
GAME CORNER!

Do you need some
game coins?

It's ¥1000 for 50
coins. Would you
like some?


Thanks! Here are
your 50 coins!


No? Please come
play sometime!


You can't afford
the coins!


Oops! Your COIN
CASE is full.


You don't have a
COIN CASE!


Keep this quiet.

It's rumored that
this place is run
by TEAM ROCKET.


I think these
machines have
different odds.


Kid, do you want
to play?


NINTEN received
10 coins!


You don't need my
coins!


Wins seem to come
and go.


I'm having a
wonderful time!


Hey!

You have better
things to do,
champ in making!

CELADON GYM's
LEADER is ERIKA!
She uses grass-
type POKéMON!

She might appear
docile, but don't
be fooled!


They offer rare
POKéMON that can
be exchanged for
your coins.

But, I just can't
seem to win!


Games are scary!
It's so easy to
get hooked!


What's up? Want
some coins?


NINTEN received
20 coins!


You have lots of
coins!


Darn! I need more
coins for the
POKéMON I want!


Hey, what? You're
throwing me off!
Here are some
coins, shoo!


NINTEN received
20 coins!


You've got your
own coins!


The trick is to
watch the reels
closely!


I'm guarding this
poster!
Go away, or else!


Dang!


Our hideout might
be discovered! I
better tell BOSS!


Hey!

A switch behind
the poster!?
Let's push it!



Oops! Forgot the

5F: DRUG STORE


I sure do fancy
that PORYGON!

But, it's hard to
win at slots!


I had a major
haul today!


Hi!

We're taking a
break now.


My POKéMON are
weak, so I often
have to go to the
DRUG STORE.


Psst! There's a
basement under
the GAME CORNER.


Munch...

The man at that
table lost it all
at the slots.


Go ahead! Laugh!

I'm flat out
busted!

No more slots for
me! I'm going
straight!

Here! I won't be
needing this any-
more!


NINTEN received
a {1.CF4A}!


Make room for
this!


I always thought
I was going to
win it back...


Hehehe! The slots
just reel in the
dough, big time!


CHIEF!

We just shipped
2000 POKéMON as
slot prizes!


Don't touch the
poster at the
GAME CORNER!

There's no secret
switch behind it!


POKéMON? No, this
is a hotel for
people.

We're full up.


I'm on vacation
with my brother
and boy friend.

CELADON is such a
pretty city!


Why did she bring
her brother?


Do you have a
SAFARI ZONE flag?

What about cards
or calendars?


Did you try X
SPEED? It speeds
up a POKéMON in
battle!


SAFARI ZONE's
WARDEN is old,
but still active!

All his teeth are
false, though.


Hmm? You've met
BILL?

He's my grandson!

He always liked
collecting things
even as a child!


BILL files his
own POKéMON data
on his PC!

Did he show you?


You can't win
with just one
strong POKéMON.

It's tough, but
you have to raise
them evenly.


There's a narrow
trail west of
VIRIDIAN CITY.

It goes to POKéMON
LEAGUE HQ.
The HQ governs
all trainers.


WARDEN: Hif fuff

Ah howhee ho hoo!

NINTEN gave the
GOLD TEETH to the
WARDEN!




The WARDEN popped
in his teeth!


WARDEN: Thanks,
kid! No one could
understand a word
that I said.

I couldn't work
that way.
Let me give you
something for
your trouble.


NINTEN received
{50}!


WARDEN: HM04
teaches STRENGTH!

It lets POKéMON
move boulders
when you're out-
side of battle.

Oh yes, did you
find SECRET HOUSE
in SAFARI ZONE?

If you do, you
win an HM!

I hear it's the
rare SURF HM.


Your pack is
stuffed full!


POKéMON photos
and fossils.


Old POKéMON
merchandise.


Welcome to the
SAFARI ZONE!


Leaving early?


Please return any
SAFARI BALLs you
have left.


Good Luck!


Did you get a
good haul?
Come again!


For just ¥500,
you can catch all
the POKéMON you
want in the park!

Would you like to
join the hunt?


That'll be ¥{2.CD3D.C3},
please!

We only use a
special POKé BALL
here.

NINTEN received
30 SAFARI BALLs!




We'll call you on
the PA when you
run out of time
or SAFARI BALLs!


OK! Please come
again!


Oops! Not enough
money!


Hi! Is it your
first time here?


SAFARI ZONE has 4
zones in it.

Each zone has
different kinds
of POKéMON. Use
SAFARI BALLs to
catch them!

When you run out
of time or SAFARI
BALLs, it's game
over for you!

Before you go,
open an unused
POKéMON BOX so
there's room for
new POKéMON!


Sorry, you're a
regular here!




Oh, all right, pay
me what you have.


But, I can't give
you all 30 BALLs.




You're persistent,
aren't you?

OK, you can go in
for free, but
just this once!





I'm sorry, but you
have to pay to
enter.


You can't enter
without paying!


I said, no money,
no entry!


Read my lips, NO!
Get it?


KOGA: Fwahahaha!

A mere child like
you dares to
challenge me?

Very well, I
shall show you
true terror as a
ninja master!

You shall feel
the despair of
poison and sleep
techniques!


Humph!
You have proven
your worth!

Here! Take the
SOULBADGE!


When afflicted by
TOXIC, POKéMON
suffer more and
more as battle
progresses!

It will surely
terrorize foes!


Now that you have
the SOULBADGE,
the DEFENSE of
your POKéMON
increases!

It also lets you
SURF outside of
battle!

Ah! Take this
too!


NINTEN received
{1.CF4A}!




TM06 contains
TOXIC!

It is a secret
technique over
400 years old!


Make space for
this, child!


Strength isn't
the key for
POKéMON!

It's strategy!

I'll show you how
strategy can beat
brute strength!


What?
Extraordinary!


So, you mix brawn
with brains?
Good strategy!


I wanted to become
a ninja, so I
joined this GYM!


I'm done
for!


I will keep on
training under
KOGA, my ninja
master!


Let's see you
beat my special
techniques!


You
had me fooled!


I like poison and
sleep techniques,
as they linger
after battle!


Stop right there!

Our invisible
walls have you
frustrated?


Whoa!
He's got it!


You impressed me!
Here's a hint!

Look very closely
for gaps in the
invisible walls!


I also study the
way of the ninja
with master KOGA!

Ninja have a long
history of using
animals!


Awoo!


I still have much
to learn!


Master KOGA comes
from a long line
of ninjas!

What did you
descend from?


Dropped
my balls!


Where there is
light, there is
shadow!

Light and shadow!
Which do you
choose?


Yo! Champ in
making!

FUCHSIA GYM is
riddled with
invisible walls!

KOGA might appear
close, but he's
blocked off!

You have to find
gaps in the walls
to reach him!


It's amazing how
ninja can terrify
even now!


We nicknamed the
WARDEN SLOWPOKE.

He and SLOWPOKE
both look vacant!


SLOWPOKE is very
knowledgeable
about POKéMON!

He even has some
fossils of rare,
extinct POKéMON!


SLOWPOKE came in,
but I couldn't
understand him.

I think he's got
a speech problem!


I'm the FISHING
GURU's older
brother!

I simply Looove
fishing!

Do you like to
fish?


Grand! I like
your style!

Take this and
fish, young one!

NINTEN received

Oh... That's so
disappointing...


Hello there,
NINTEN!

How are the fish
biting?


Oh no!

You have no room
for my gift!


Who are you? There
shouldn't be
anyone here.


Ouch!


A key? I don't
know what you're
talking about.


A secret switch!

Press it?


Who wouldn't?


Not quite yet!


Hah!

I am BLAINE! I
am the LEADER of
CINNABAR GYM!

My fiery POKéMON
will incinerate
all challengers!

Hah! You better
have BURN HEAL!


I have
burnt out!

You have earned
the VOLCANOBADGE!


FIRE BLAST is the
ultimate fire
technique!

Don't waste it on
water POKéMON!


Hah!

The VOLCANOBADGE
heightens the
SPECIAL abilities
of your POKéMON!

Here, you can
have this too!


NINTEN received
{1.CF4A}!




TM38 contains
FIRE BLAST!

Teach it to fire-
type POKéMON!

CHARMELEON or
PONYTA would be
good bets!


Make room for my
gift!


Do you know how
hot POKéMON fire
breath can get?


Yow!
Hot, hot, hot!


Fire, or to be
more precise,
combustion...

Blah, blah, blah,
blah...


I was a thief, but
I became straight
as a trainer!


I
surrender!


I can't help
stealing other
people's POKéMON!


You can't win!
I have studied
POKéMON totally!


Waah!
My studies!


My theories are
too complicated
for you!


I just like using
fire POKéMON!


Too hot
to handle!


I wish there was
a thief POKéMON!
I'd use that!


I know why BLAINE
became a trainer!


Ow!


BLAINE was lost
in the mountains
when a fiery bird
POKéMON appeared.

Its light enabled
BLAINE to find
his way down!


I've been to many
GYMs, but this is
my favorite!


Yowza!
Too hot!


Us fire POKéMON
fans like PONYTA
and NINETALES!


Fire is weak
against H2O!


Oh!
Snuffed out!


Water beats fire!
But, fire melts
ice POKéMON!


Yo! Champ in
making!

The hot-headed
BLAINE is a fire
POKéMON pro!

Douse his spirits
with water!

You better take
some BURN HEALs!


NINTEN! You beat
that fire brand!


This GYM is also
known as the QUIZ
GYM.

You have to take a
quiz if you want
to see BLAINE.

You don't have to
fight us if you
get it right.


Think you can do
it?


This one's tricky!


POKéMON enjoy
quizzes too!


I like it here at
QUIZ GYM.


This is the last
question.


Come on, answer
the question!


We study POKéMON
extensively here.

People often bring
us rare POKéMON
for examination.

EEVEE can evolve

There's an e-mail

Hiya!

I am important
doctor!

I study here rare
POKéMON fossils!

You! Have you a
fossil for me?


No! Is too bad!


I take a little
time!

You go for walk a
little while!


Where were you?

Your fossil is
back to life!

It was {1.CF4A}
like I think!


Oh! That is
{1.CD6D}!

It is fossil of
{1.CF4A}, a
POKéMON that is
already extinct!

My Resurrection
Machine will make
that POKéMON live
again!


So! You hurry and
give me that!

NINTEN handed
over {1.CD6D}!


I take a little
time!

You go for walk a
little while!


Aiyah! You come
again!


You can cancel
evolution.

When a POKéMON is
evolving, you can
stop it and leave
it the way it is.


Do you have any
friends?

POKéMON you get
in trades grow
very quickly.

I think it's
worth a try!


Don't they have X
ATTACK? It's good
for battles!


It never hurts to
have extra items!


Yo! Champ in
making!

At POKéMON LEAGUE,
you have to face
the ELITE FOUR in
succession.

If you lose, you
have to start all
over again! This
is it! Go for it!


From here on, you
face the ELITE
FOUR one by one!

If you win, a
door opens to the
next trainer!
Good luck!


My daughter is so
self-centered.
She only has a

My daughter likes

Her mimicry has

CHANSEY: Chaaan

NINTEN: Hi! Do
you like POKéMON?

NINTEN: Uh no, I

NINTEN: Huh?
You're strange!

COPYCAT: Hmm?
Quit mimicking?

But, I beseech
you, do not take
our emblem as
your trophy!

In return, I will
give you a prized

Choose whichever
one you like!


Ho!

Stay and train at
Karate with us!


Hoargh! Take your
shoes off!


I give
up!


You wait 'til you

I'm a small fry

I hear you're

Judge!

Our Master is a

Nothing tough
frightens me!

I break boulders

Yow!
Stubbed fingers!


The only thing
that frightens us
is psychic power!


Hoohah!

You're trespassing
in our FIGHTING
DOJO!


Oof!
I give up!


The prime fighters

train here.


You want the

HITMONLEE?


You want the

HITMONCHAN?


Better not get
greedy...


I had a vision of
your arrival!

I have had psychic
powers since I
was a child.

I first learned
to bend spoons
with my mind.

I dislike fight-
ing, but if you
wish, I will show
you my powers!


I'm
shocked!
But, a loss is a
loss.

I admit I didn't
work hard enough
to win!

You earned the
MARSHBADGE!


Everyone has
psychic power!
People just don't
realize it!


The MARSHBADGE
makes POKéMON up
to L70 obey you!

Stronger POKéMON
will become wild,
ignoring your
orders in battle!

Just don't raise
your POKéMON too
much!

Wait, please take

Yo! Champ in

SABRINA's POKéMON
use psychic power
instead of force!

Fighting POKéMON
are weak against
psychic POKéMON!

They get creamed
before they can
even aim a punch!


Psychic power,
huh?

If I had that,
I'd make a bundle
at the slots!


SABRINA is younger
than I, but I
respect her!


Not
good enough!


In a battle of
equals, the one
with the stronger

If you wish
to beat SABRINA,
focus on winning!


Does our unseen
power scare you?


I never
foresaw this!


Psychic POKéMON
fear only bugs!


POKéMON take on
the appearance of
their trainers.

Your POKéMON must
be tough, then!


I knew
it!


I must teach
better techniques
to my POKéMON!


You know that
power alone isn't
enough!


I don't
believe this!


SABRINA just wiped
out the KARATE
MASTER next door!


You and I, our
POKéMON shall
fight!


I lost
after all!


I knew that this
was going to take
place.


SABRINA is young,
but she's also
our LEADER!

You won't reach
her easily!


I lost
my concentration!


There used to be
2 POKéMON GYMs in
SAFFRON.

The FIGHTING DOJO

its GYM status
when we went and
creamed them!


SAFFRON POKéMON

its psychics!

You want to see
SABRINA!
I can tell!


Arrrgh!


That's right! I

Hey! Don't look

feel great!

Sure, you can go

I'm sorry I was
so rude to you!

I see you're using
a POKéDEX.

I'll show you how
to catch POKéMON
as my apology.


That didn't work!
I must be losing

I've run out of
POKé BALLs too.

I have to get some
at POKéMON MART.


Those POKé BALLs

You have POKéMON!

It's great that
you can carry and

It can go for days
without eating a
single morsel.

In the bulb on
its back, it
stores energy.


The bulb on its
back grows by
drawing energy.

It gives off an
aroma when it is
ready to bloom.


The flower on its
back catches the
sun's rays.

The sunlight is
then absorbed and
used for energy.


The flame at the
tip of its tail
makes a sound as

it burns. You can
only hear it in
quiet places.


Tough fights could
excite this
POKéMON. When

excited, it may
blow out bluish-
white flames.


When expelling a
blast of super
hot fire, the red

flame at the tip
of its tail burns
more intensely.


Shoots water at
prey while in the
water.

Withdraws into
its shell when in
danger.


When tapped, this
POKéMON will pull
in its head, but

its tail will
still stick out a
little bit.


Once it takes aim
at its enemy, it
blasts out water

with even more
force than a fire
hose.


If you touch the
feeler on top of
its head, it will

release a horrible
stink to protect
itself.


Hardens its shell
to protect itself.
However, a large

impact may cause
it to pop out of
its shell.


Its wings, covered
with poisonous
powders, repel

water. This
allows it to fly
in the rain.


Beware of the
sharp stinger on
its head. It

hides in grass
and bushes where
it eats leaves.


Able to move only
slightly. When
endangered, it

may stick out its
stinger and poison
its enemy.


It has 3 poisonous
stingers on its
forelegs and its

tail. They are
used to jab its
enemy repeatedly.


Very docile. If
attacked, it will
often kick up

sand to protect
itself rather
than fight back.


This POKéMON is
full of vitality.
It constantly

flies around its
large territory in
search of prey.


This POKéMON flies
at Mach 2 speed,
seeking prey.

Its large talons
are feared as
wicked weapons.


Will chew on any-
thing with its
fangs. If you see

one, it is certain
that 40 more live
in the area.


Its hind feet are
webbed. They act
as flippers, so

it can swim in
rivers and hunt
for prey.


Inept at flying
high. However, it
can fly around

very fast to
protect its ter-
ritory.


A POKéMON that
dates back many
years. If it

senses danger, it
flies high and
away, instantly.


The older it gets,
the longer it
grows. At night,

it wraps its long
body around tree
branches to rest.


The frightening
patterns on its
belly have been

studied. Six
variations have
been confirmed.


It keeps its tail
raised to monitor
its surroundings.

If you yank its
tail, it will try
to bite you.


When electricity
builds up inside
its body, it

becomes feisty.
It also glows in
the dark.


Its body is dry.
When it gets cold
at night, its

hide is said to
become coated with
a fine dew.


It is skilled at
slashing enemies
with its claws.

If broken, they
start to grow back
in a day.


A mild-mannered
POKéMON that does
not like to

fight. Beware, its
small horns
secrete venom.


When resting deep
in its burrow, its
thorns always

retract.
This is proof that
it is relaxed.


Tough scales cover
the sturdy body
of this POKéMON.

It appears that
the scales grow
in cycles.


Its large ears
are always kept
upright. If it

senses danger, it
will attack with a
poisonous sting.


Its horns contain
venom. If they
are stabbed into

an enemy, the
impact makes the
poison leak out.


Its steel-like
hide adds to its
powerful tackle.

Its horns are so
hard, they can
pierce a diamond.


Adored for their
cute looks and
playfulness. They

are thought to be
rare, as they do
not appear often.


They appear to be
very protective of
their own world.

It is a kind of
fairy, rarely seen
by people.


Both its fur and
its tails are
beautiful. As it

grows, the tails
split and form
more tails.


According to an
enduring legend,
9 noble saints

were united and
reincarnated as
this POKéMON.


Uses its alluring
eyes to enrapture
its foe. It then

sings a pleasing
melody that lulls
the foe to sleep.


Its body is full
of elasticity. By
inhaling deeply,

it can continue
to inflate itself
without limit.


Emits ultrasonic
cries while it
flies. They act

as a sonar used
to check for ob-
jects in its way.


It attacks in a
stealthy manner,
without warning.

Its sharp fangs
are used to bite
and suck blood.


It may be mistaken
for a clump of
weeds. If you try

to yank it out of
the ground, it
shrieks horribly.


Smells incredibly
foul! However,
around 1 out of

1,000 people enjoy
sniffing its nose-
bending stink.


Flaps its broad
flower petals to
scatter its

poisonous pollen.
The flapping sound
is very loud.


Burrows under the
ground to gnaw on
tree roots. The

mushrooms on its
back absorb most
of the nutrition.


The bug host is
drained of energy
by the mushrooms

on its back. They
appear to do all
the thinking.


Its large eyes act
as radars. In a
bright place, you

can see that they
are clusters of
many tiny eyes.


The powdery scales
on its wings are
hard to remove.

They also contain
poison that leaks
out on contact.


It prefers dark
places. It spends
most of its time

underground,
though it may pop
up in caves.


A team of triplets
that can burrow
over 60 MPH.

Due to this, some
people think it's
an earthquake.


Appears to be more
active at night.
It loves round

and shiny things.
It can't stop from
picking them up.


The gem in its
forehead glows on
its own! It walks

with all the grace
and elegance of a
proud queen.


Always tormented
by headaches.
It uses psychic

powers, but it is
not known if it
intends to do so.


Its slim and long
limbs end in broad
flippers. They

are used for swim-
ming gracefully
in lakes.


An agile POKéMON
that lives in
trees. It angers

easily and will
not hesitate to
attack anything.


It stops being
angry only when
nobody else is

around. To view
this moment is
very difficult.


A POKéMON with a
friendly nature.
However, it will

bark fiercely at
anything invading
its territory.


A legendary POKé-
MON in China.
Many people are

charmed by its
grace and beauty
while running.


The direction of
the spiral on the
belly differs by

area. It is more
adept at swimming
than walking.


Under attack, it
uses its belly
spiral to put the

foe to sleep. It
then makes its
escape.


Swims powerfully
using all the
muscles in its

body. It can even
overtake champion
swimmers.


Sleeps 18 hours a
day. If it senses
danger, it will

teleport itself to
safety even as it
sleeps.


Many odd things
happen if this
POKéMON is close

by. For example,
it makes clocks
run backwards.


A POKéMON that can
memorize anything.
It never forgets

what it learns--
that's why this
POKéMON is smart.


Very powerful in
spite of its small
size. Its mastery

of many types of
martial arts makes
it very tough.


The belt around
its waist holds
back its energy.

Without it, this
POKéMON would be
unstoppable.


One arm alone can
move mountains.
Using all four

arms, this POKéMON
fires off awesome
punches.


Prefers hot and
humid places.
It ensnares tiny

insects with its
vines and devours
them.


When hungry, it
swallows anything
that moves. Its

hapless prey is
melted inside by
strong acids.


Lures prey with
the sweet aroma of
honey. Swallowed

whole, the prey is
melted in a day,
bones and all.


It can sometimes
be found all dry
and shriveled up

on a beach. Toss
it back into the
sea to revive it.


Its 80 tentacles
can stretch and
contract freely.

They wrap around
prey and weaken
it with poison.


Commonly found
near mountain
trails, etc.

If you step on
one by accident,
it gets angry.


Often seen rolling
down mountain
trails. Obstacles

are just things to
roll straight
over, not avoid.


Once it sheds its
skin, its body
turns tender and

whitish. Its hide
hardens when it's
exposed to air.


Capable of jumping
incredibly high.
Its hooves and

sturdy legs absorb
the impact of a
hard landing.


Just loves to run.
If it sees some-
thing faster than

itself, it will
give chase at top
speed.


Incredibly slow
and sluggish. It
is quite content

to loll about
without worrying
about the time.


Lives lazily by
the sea. If the
SHELLDER on its

tail comes off,
it becomes a
SLOWPOKE again.


It is born with
the ability to
defy gravity. It

floats in air on
powerful electro-
magnetic waves.


Generates strange
radio signals. It
raises the tem-

perature by 3.6F
degrees within
3,300 feet.


Lives where reedy
plants grow. They
are rarely seen,

so it's thought
their numbers are
decreasing.


Its short wings
make flying dif-
ficult. Instead,

this POKéMON runs
at high speed on
developed legs.


One of DODUO's 2
heads splits to
form a unique

species. It runs
close to 40 MPH
in prairies.


Loves freezing
cold conditions.
Relishes swimming

in a frigid cli-
mate of around 14F
degrees.


Its entire body is
a snowy-white.
Unharmed by even

intense cold, it
swims powerfully
in icy waters.


Made of hardened
sludge. It smells
too putrid to

touch.
Even weeds won't
grow in its path.


Smells so awful,
it can cause
fainting. Through

degeneration, it
lost its sense of
smell.


The shell can
withstand any
attack. However,

when it is open,
the tender body
is exposed.


For protection, it
uses its harder-
than-diamonds

shell. It also
shoots spikes from
the shell.


Said to appear in
decrepit, deserted
buildings. It has

no real shape as
it appears to be
made of a gas.


By licking, it
saps the victim's
life. It causes

shaking that won't
stop until the
victim's demise.


A GENGAR is close
by if you feel a
sudden chill.

It may be trying
to lay a curse
on you.


Burrows at high
speed in search
of food. The

tunnels it leaves
are used as homes
by DIGLETTs.


If you sleep by
it all the time,
it will sometimes

show you dreams
it has eaten in
the past.


Avoid eye contact
if you come across
one. It will try

to put you to
sleep by using
its pendulum.


Its pincers are
superb weapons.
They sometimes

break off during
battle, but they
grow back fast.


One claw grew
massively and as
hard as steel.

It has 10,000-HP
strength. However,
it is too heavy.


It is said to
camouflage itself
as a POKé BALL. It

will self-destruct
with very little
stimulus.


Stores electrical
energy inside its
body. Even the

slightest shock
could trigger a
huge explosion.


The heads attract
each other and
spin around.

There must be 6
heads for it to
maintain balance.


Its cries are very
noisy. This is
because each of

the 3 heads thinks
about whatever it
likes.


Wears the skull
of its deceased
mother. Its cries

echo inside the
skull and come out
as a sad melody.


Small and weak,
this POKéMON is
adept with its

bone club. It has
grown more vicious
over the ages.


When kicking, the
sole of its foot
turns as hard as

a diamond on im-
pact and destroys
its enemy.


Punches in cork-
screw fashion. It
can punch its way

through a concrete
wall in the same
way as a drill.


Its tongue spans
almost 7 feet and
moves more freely

than its forelegs.
Its licks can
cause paralysis.


In hot places, its
internal gases
could expand and

explode without
any warning. Be
very careful!


It lives and grows
by absorbing dust,
germs and poison

gases that are
contained in toxic
waste and garbage.


A POKéMON with a
one-track mind.
Once it charges,

it won't stop
running until it
falls asleep.


Walks on its hind
legs. Shows signs
of intelligence.

Its armor-like
hide even repels
molten lava.


A gentle and kind-
hearted POKéMON
that shares its

nutritious eggs
if it sees an
injured POKéMON.


Its identity is
obscured by masses
of thick, blue

vines. The vines
are said to never
stop growing.


Raises its young
in its belly
pouch. Won't run

from any fight
to keep its young
protected.


If it senses any
danger, it will
vigorously spray

water or a special
type of ink from
its mouth.


Touching the back
fin causes numb-
ness. It hooks

its tail to coral
to stay in place
while sleeping.


When it is time
for them to lay
eggs, they can be

seen swimming up
rivers and falls
in large groups.


It is the male's
job to make a
nest by carving

out boulders in a
stream using the
horn on its head.


As long as the
center section is
unharmed, it can

grow back fully
even if it is
chopped to bits.


The center section
is named the core.
People think it

is communicating
when it glows in
7 colors.


Always practices
its pantomime act.
It makes enemies

believe something
exists that
really doesn't.


Leaps out of tall
grass and slices
prey with its

scythes. The move-
ment looks like
that of a ninja.


Appears to move
to a rhythm of
its own, as if it

were dancing. It
wiggles its hips
as it walks.


If a major power
outage occurs, it
is certain that

this POKéMON has
eaten electricity
at a power plant.


Born in an active
volcano. Its body
is always cloaked

in flames, so it
looks like a big
ball of fire.


Grips its prey in
its pincers and
squeezes hard! It

can't move if it's
cold, so it lives
in warm places.


A rowdy POKéMON
with a lot of
stamina. Once

running, it won't
stop until it hits
something.


Famous for being
very unreliable.
It can be found

swimming in seas,
lakes, rivers and
shallow puddles.


Brutally vicious
and enormously
destructive.

Known for totally
destroying cities
in ancient times.


A gentle soul that
can read the minds
of people. It can

ferry people
across the sea on
its back.


When it spots an
enemy, its body
transfigures into

an almost perfect
copy of its oppo-
nent.


Its genetic code
is unstable, so it
could evolve in

a variety of ways.
There are only a
few alive.


Its cell structure
is similar to
water molecules.

It will melt away
and become invis-
ible in water.


A sensitive POKé-
MON that easily
becomes sad or

angry. Every time
its mood changes,
it charges power.


It has a flame
chamber inside its
body. It inhales,

then blows out
fire that is over
3,000F degrees.


The only POKéMON
people anticipate
can fly into

space. None has
managed the feat
yet, however.


An ancient POKéMON
that was recovered
from a fossil. It

swims by cleverly
twisting its 10
tentacles about.


Sharp beaks ring
its mouth. Its
shell was too big

for it to move
freely, so it
became extinct.


A POKéMON that was
recovered from a
fossil. It uses

the eyes on its
back while hiding
on the sea floor.


A slim and fast
swimmer. It slices
its prey with its

sharp sickles and
drinks the body
fluids.


A savage POKéMON
that died out in
ancient times. It

was resurrected
using DNA taken
from amber.


Will eat anything,
even if the food
happens to be a

little moldy. It
never gets an
upset stomach.


A legendary bird
POKéMON. It
freezes water

that is contained
in winter air and
makes it snow.


This legendary
bird POKéMON is
said to appear

when the sky turns
dark and lightning
showers down.


A legendary bird
POKéMON. As it
flaps its flaming

wings, even the
night sky will
turn red.


The existence of
this mythical
POKéMON was only

recently confirmed
by a fisherman
who caught one.


According to a
witness, its body
was surrounded by

a strange aura
that gave it a
mystical look.


It is said that
this POKéMON lives
somewhere in the

sea and that it
flies. However, it
is only a rumor.


Its DNA is almost
the same as MEW's.
However, its size

and disposition
are vastly dif-
ferent.


When viewed
through a micro-
scope, this

POKéMON's short,
fine, delicate
hair can be seen.
