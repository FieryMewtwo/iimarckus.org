I was browsing /vp/ yesterday and saw people talking about
“<a href="https://boards.4channel.org/vp/thread/37586490">something spaceworld
related coming tomorrow.</a>”
It was news to me, so I stopped by the usual haunts, asked what was up,
and got the zip of assets, a few hours before the stream started.
<p>
Apparently RacieB, a legit person in the Telefang scene, had planned to stream
the translated Space World ’97 demo, but the translation was clearly not getting
finished fast enough (there’s a shocker).
The streamers wanted something interesting to put on stream,
and Helix Chamber had been planning to publish the assets,
so someone in between made a Red/Blue hack that inserted the data—evolutions,
backpics, overworld sprites, and a title screen—alongside fanmade frontpics,
translated text, and made‐up text.
Immediately after the stream, they would publish the zip and a series of
articles about the content.

<h2>Is it real?</h2>
<p>
My opinion? Most likely real.
I didn’t know the assets existed,
but I know where they came from and was expecting <em>something</em>
from that direction eventually.
The technical details behind the assets match what I expected.

<h2>Care to share those technical details?</h2>
<p>
Not really, no.

<h2>Why not?</h2>
<p>
Unlike <a href="/spaceworld/">the SW97 incident</a>,
people are sensitive about the details getting out.
I want to be clued in next time there’s an interesting leak,
and I don’t feel like giving that up to sate the curiosity of Internet randos.
Maybe if there were no other way for it to get out—but I actually expect the
source for this one to come out in time with an acceptable level of provenance,
even if it’s not going to be soon.

<h2>So why should we believe you?</h2>
<p>
Beats me. Unlike last time, I haven’t seen the source directly myself:
I’m one layer removed. If you listen to me, you’ll be two layers removed.
I do assert that I, being both technical and skeptical,
am nevertheless reasonably satisfied it’s real,
and as far as I know there’s nothing of note left to leak besides provenance.

<h2>Stream donations wargle bargle</h2>
<p>
Nothing to do with me.

<h2>Where’s the ROM, you collectionist pig?</h2>
<p>
Sorry. The assets are real, but there is no ROM to leak.
