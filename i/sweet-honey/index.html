<h2>Sweet Honey</h2>
<p>Text describing “sweet honey” appears in Gold and Silver. What’s most interesting about this is that “honey” is an item appearing in the later Pokémon games Diamond and Pearl. It’s possible that Sweet Honey was a concept that was canned (or reworked into Headbutt or Sweet Scent) and re‐implemented several years later.
