<h2>Entei Encounter</h2>
<p>An event to catch Entei, different from the standard “chase around Johto” event, exists in Gold and Silver. It doesn’t seem to be referenced by any game code, and has no details of the circumstances surrounding the encounter.
<p>The script does three things:
<ol>
<li>Prints text
<li>Plays Entei’s cry
<li>Starts a battle with a level 40 Entei
</ol>
<p>The text printed says this:</p>
<blockquote class="game">
	<p><strong>Entei</strong>: Bufuu!
</blockquote>
<p>This event is exclusive to Entei. Suicune and Raikou do not have any events like this one.
<p>The script only exists in Gold and Silver, and was removed from Pokémon Crystal.
