<h2>Default Names</h2>
<p>In the original Pokémon games, Pocket Monsters Red and Green, the developers inserted a small easter egg. When the game is turned on, the rival’s name is initialized to <span lang="ja" title="ishihara">いしはら</span>—“Ishihara,” named after Pokémon developer Tsunekazu Ishihara. (Mr. Ishihara is now president of the Pokémon Company, which did not exist at the time.) In addition, the player’s name is set to <span lang="ja" title="yamaguchi">やまぐち</span>—“Yamaguchi,” named after Wataru Yamaguchi, who is listed under “Special Thanks” in the game credits.
<p>The special edition Pocket Monsters Blue had some changes: the hidden player’s name was changed to <span lang="ja" title="gefuri">ゲーフリ</span>, an abbreviation of Game Freak—the producers of the Pokémon video games. The rival’s name became <span lang="ja" title="kuricha">クリチャ</span>, a reference to Creatures, Inc., which owns part of the Pokémon copyright and distributes the toys and games.
<p>Pocket Monsters Yellow later used <span lang="ja" title="gefuri1">ゲーフリ1</span> for the player, adding only a single digit to the end of Blue’s default name. The rival name was unchanged.
<p class="game">This in‐joke was even included in the English versions of the game, with a major difference. The player’s name became <strong>Ninten</strong>, while the rival’s became <strong>Sony</strong>! This is obviously a tongue‐in‐cheek reference to Sony’s PlayStation system, which competed with Nintendo’s major game console of the time, the Nintendo 64.
