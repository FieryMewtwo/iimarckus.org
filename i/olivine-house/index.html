<h2>“Deleted” House in Olivine</h2>
<p>Gold, Silver, and Crystal have several beta maps, but only a few can be considered complete. One of these is a “deleted” house located in Olivine City.
<div><img src="olivine-house.png" alt="The house in Olivine" title="The house in Olivine"></div>
<p>Two interactions can occur in this map. The first is a Rhydon. This Rhydon uses a glitched sprite that changes to a Clefairy during the walking animation.
<blockquote class="game">
	<p><strong>Rhydon</strong>: Gugooh!

</blockquote>
<p>The other is a woman who says:</p>
<blockquote class="game">
	<p>When my <strong>Pokémon</strong> got sick, the <strong>Pharmacist</strong> in <strong>Ecruteak</strong> made some medicine for me.
</blockquote>
<p>Notice how she claims the pharmacy is located in Ecruteak City. In the final version of the game, the pharmacy was found in Cianwood City.

<p>This is one of three complete beta maps in Gold and Silver (the other two forming <a href="i/safari-zone">the Safari Zone</a>). Rather than delete the map completely, the programmers moved the “warp tile” (a means of accessing a map, usually placed on top of an image displaying a door or hole) to the upper‐left corner of Olivine City.
<p>This map can be accessed with the following Gameshark codes.
<p>Gold/Silver:
<div><code class="shark">010143D0
010144D0
010445D0</code></div>
<p>Crystal:
<div><code class="shark">0101B4DC
0101B5DC
0104B6DC</code></div>
