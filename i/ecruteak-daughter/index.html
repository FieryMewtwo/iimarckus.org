<h2>Daughter’s Quest</h2>
<p>Some in‐game text implies that a sidequest involving the Burned Tower was scrapped at some point in development.
<blockquote class="game">
	<p>Oh, no. Oh, no… My daughter is missing. No… She couldn’t have gone to the <strong>Burned Tower</strong>. I told her not to go near it… People seem to disappear there… Oh, what should I do…?
</blockquote>
<p>Although it has no event data associated with it, this block of text is found near the dialogue encountered in Ecruteak City, outside of buildings. The idea of a possible sidequest involving a lost daughter is intriguing to think about. It might even have morphed into the lost granddaughter sidequest on the S.S. Aqua.
