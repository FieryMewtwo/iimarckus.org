I don’t track or keep any logs of anyone who uploads using this form.

But if you don’t trust my assurances,
download <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor Browser</a> and use
<a href="http://bdqx5tj6dsd5ukbk2nrl3owgkzkv3hhyt4shmdvf2qgbqy3h7pyni2id.onion/">this hidden service</a> instead.
Tor prevents me from identifying you even if I try.

<form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data" action="/upload">
<p><input type="file" name="file[]" multiple>
<p><button type="submit">Send Files</button>
</form>
